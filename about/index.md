I am a data scientist with 10+ years of experience in Python, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. Currently, I work building predictive models for [6sense](https://6sense.com). Prior to this I was a number of things: Fellow in the [Insight Data Science program](www.insightdatascience.com), science teacher at [Astrocamp](http://astrocamp.org/california/), and physicist at the University of Wisconsin.

I am also an avid amateur adventurer in the outdoors and have been developing a growing interest in painting and photography, all of which I post about on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dancarmody/).

## Research
My PhD work was focused on the characterization of instabilities in a magnetically confined plasma and the turbulence that arises as a result. In particular, my work was concerned with the reversed field pinch, a magnetic confinement fusion concept device. A copy of my thesis can be downloaded <a href="carmody_thesis.pdf">here</a>.
