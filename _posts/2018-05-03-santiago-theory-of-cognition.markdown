excerpt: "Successful transformations toward effective science and policy at large scales tend to emerge from informal networks that help facilitate information flows, identify knowledge gaps, and creates nodes of expertise."

Over the last several years I've become quite interested in the methods and ideas of complex systems research, and with a deep interest as well in ecology and conservation, I picked up Charles Curtin's book, The Science of Open Spaces. One of the main points that Curtin makes is that effective conservation policy is predicated on the capacity of individuals and organizations to learn, both from other entities associated with the land and/or involved in the process of conservation, as well as from the process itself and its generated effects.

For example, on this process of learning he says, "Learning emerges from the interaction of individuals and organizations and the social and ecological systems within which they are embedded." So learning is emergent, a core idea of complex systems, and this kind of complex emergence is further stressed when he writes that learning is "a self-organized process in which the more information is available, the greater the potential for success." 

Curtin uses this perspective to discuss underlying cognitive processes and to introduce something called the 'Santiago theory of cognition', which states that "cognition is the very process of life, including perception, emotion, and behavior." This comes across as a very broad and all-encompassing statement, and I was curious to know more about the Santiago theory.

Named after Santiago, Chile, where the main proponents of this theory were based, the essential idea is that cognition - the act of thinking - is less about what goes on in a particular brain and more about the interactions between that brain and its environment. As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago's_theory_of_cognition) puts it, "Cognition is considered as the ability of adaptation in a certain environment," or in other words, a system that adapts to overcome problems arising in its environment is in a very real sense 'thinking' its way through these problems, whether or not that system is a single brain or a collection of individuals and organizations.

This is all interesting, but it seems very abstract and theoretical for a discussion on conservation. What is Curtin's point? His point is that "successful transformations toward effective science and policy at large scales tend to emerge from informal networks that help facilitate information flows, identify knowledge gaps, and creates nodes of expertise." In other words, we shouldn't necessarily expect to think our way through hard policy problems, or that effective policy can be generated by a few minds acting in isolation. Rather, the goal should be to construct a distributed mind, one that exists as a flexible network of problem solvers that take autonomous action and explore the solution space, communicate openly with one another, and slowly generate consensus to move in a more informal way towards a successful outcome.
