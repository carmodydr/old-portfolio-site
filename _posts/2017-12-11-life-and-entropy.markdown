Life and entropy are fundamentally linked, an idea touched upon by several books I've had in my queue recently. In his book *Darwin's Dangerous Idea*, Daniel Dennet explores the algorithmic processes that have lead to the emergence of life and the growth of complex organisms, and in this discussion arises the need to define life and set boundaries for what differentiates it from the rest of the inanimate world. Entropy plays a key role in setting these boundaries (a topic partially explored in Schrodinger's *What is Life?*), leading James Lovelock to declare that in the search for extraterrestrial life we must be on the lookout for "an entropy reduction, since this must be a general characteristic of life."

In the *What Technology Wants*, Kevin Kelly extends many of the algorithmic ideas about the growth of complexity within the biosphere to include the technosphere as well (what Kelly calls the **technium**). He also gives many pages of thought to the notion of negative entropy, dubbed **exotropy**, which is the reversal of disorder that Lovelock declared to be a fundamentally distinguishing characteristic of life. For both life and the technium, this local reduction in entropy comes at the expense of a global increase. In the words of biochemist Albert Lehninger, "Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings free energy, in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy."A living organism survives by taking structured energy in the world around it and producing less structured waste energy, in the process using this transformation to repair and possibly grow itself.

As a physicist I want to be rigorous about the use of entropy, a topic that is often misunderstood and misrepresented even among physicists (even and especially myself). The original definition of entropy was formulated in the context of closed systems at statistical equilibrium, and it was given a rigorous definition in terms of the number of microscopic configurations available to describe a given macroscopic state. It can be quite a leap to use this idea to describe what is taking place in an arbitrary complex, interconnected system. 

Intuitively, the idea of entropy seems to apply to the world we see around us, in which there is a constant battle between order and disorder, organization and chaos. We recognize that it takes energy to keep things together when the natural tendency seems to be for everything to fall apart. When discussing the dispersal of gas in a closed room, entropy is a well formulated physical concept. Does it maintain some kind of rigor at the level of human beings, or is it just a useful metaphor?

For the moment, I want to set aside the question of rigor and focus on the value of the metaphor. We can intuitively grasp the tendency of the universe (or the world, or ourselves) towards chaos, just as we can see the effort required to maintain our lives and the world around us. Maintaining a complex system requires the expenditure of energy, and all energy transformations necessitate the creation of waste energy in the form of heat. This means that Life is both a fight against entropy as well as a vehicle for its increase. It may even be the case that, globally, entropy increases more than it is reduced in the living system. Life, anywhere and in any form, is a way for the universe to hasten its approach to maximum entropy.

There is a paper from a few years ago that [applies the rigor of statistical mechanics to cellular self-replication](http://www.englandlab.com/uploads/7/8/0/3/7803054/2013jcpsrep.pdf). Although I have yet to work through and understand the calculations, the paper's author, Jeremy England, [states](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-thermodynamics-theory-of-the-origin-of-life-20140122/) that some of his work shows "the more likely evolutionary outcomes are going to be the ones that absorbed and dissipated more energy from the environmentâ€™s external drives on the way to getting there." In other words, there is an evolutionary pressure in favor of systems that can more readily make use of energy from their environment. The better able a system is to find and use resources, the more likely it is to survive and propagate.

Technology exists because it has made human beings more efficient at finding and using resources. As we have developed our technology it has begun to take on a life of its own, some of it even beginning to achieve something akin to an autonomous metabolism, like a flashlight's periodic consumption of batteries. We feed our tech because it is useful to us, and we maintain our technical systems through the extraction and processing of resources from the natural world. The technology of our transportation infrastructure is maintained through rebuilding bridges and repaving roads. Our information infrastructure is maintained through the mining of rare metals and the production of energy. Kelly believes that the growth of the technium - its complexity, its order, its need for energy and exotropic increase - is a natural extension of organic life, a virtually inevitable result of our push to organize the world and make our way through it.

The tragedy of technology is that the benefits it presents, the paths it opens for people to explore creativity and self-awareness, come with costs: energy, resources, and the conversion of order into disorder that must occur in the environment around it. Kelly believes that the positives outweigh the negatives, that everything enabled by tech more than accounts for its downsides. There are too many variables to run an accurate cost-benefit analysis, and so it comes down to a matter of faith. In any case, if entropy increase is in fact a natural by-product of any complex system, then life itself necessarily involves a certain amount of chaos to be produced. In other words, destruction is inevitable, an unavoidable outcome of existence.

As a proponent of both science/tech as well as ecology I am often confronted with the dueling requirements of pushing forward the former at the expense of the latter. I appreciate the knowledge opened up by science, the abilities opened up by technology, and the vastness and beauty of the natural world. I want to find ways to live as sustainably as I can, to reduce/reuse/recycle, to make the world greener. Essentially: to do no harm. Unfortunately, the avoidance of harm cannot be a primary goal, since carried to its logical conclusion it negates all life. Instead, I must attempt to find a comfortable compromise, some line in the sand that delineates my behavior, and move on. For while the negative aspects of living are unavoidable, the positive aspects are not. Destruction is inevitable, creation is not.
