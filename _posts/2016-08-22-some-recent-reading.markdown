Although busy over the summer, I managed to put some time into reading recently, covering three short books in a similarly short amount of time. Gabriel Garcia Marquez's *Chronicle of a Death Foretold*, Chinua Achebe's *Things Fall Apart*, and Cory Doctorow's *Little Brother*. The first two are more obviously grouped together, so I'll save the third for a future post.

Normally after reading a book I set it down and quickly move on to whatever is next, but I've been making more of an effort to do some post-processing on the art and literature that I consume. That said, I aim to keep it brief.

### Chronicle of a Death Foretold ###

Marquez' novel has the same flavor of the other books of his that I've read, wistful and nostalgic. His stories always seem to have the tone of some wizened storyteller look back on a series of events, likely tragic, and relating how they could not have unfolded in any other way. In *Chronicle of a Death Foretold* one of these storytellers relates to us the inevitability of the fate of Santiago Nasar, a man whose crime was the premarital deflowering of a young woman and whose punishment was death. He dies, murdered by Pablo and Pedro, the bride-to-be's brothers, a pair who have their own inevitable role to play in this tragedy. We are told the outcome of the story at the beginning, so there is no mystery to solve, only that of why the rest of the town allowed the event to unfold despite the brothers' clearly and repeatedly stated intentions. It is a story of inaction, of circumstance, and of the tragic inevitability of fate. It is a beautifully written book, filled with the imaginative language that Marquez is known for, although both language and story lack something of the depth of *100 Years of Solitude* or *Love in the Time of Cholera*. The characters are more flat and less personable, and everything stays entirely implanted within reality, without the fantastical embellishment that gives his other stories their dreamlike tone.

### Things Fall Apart ###

I first heard of Chinua Achebe from someone while working at Astrocamp. He was talking up Achebe's essay on the inherent racism of Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*, an essay he described as a masterful deconstruction of the classic novel and a watershed moment for the African viewpoint in literacy criticism. *Things Fall Apart* was Achebe's first novel and is itself considered to be the first distinctly African modern novel (in English, at least). The story follows the rise and fall of Okonkwo, an archetypally proud and strong man in a rural Nigerian village. His life and character are revealed to us through a series of more or less disconnected events, anecdotes of how Okonkwo became, through force of will and hard effort, a respected and privileged member of his community. The book cover states that "it is often compared to the great Greek tragedies", and so it is as we watch while, beset by a series of hardships and character driven decisions, Okonkwo's unyielding will causes events to unfold in their heroically tragic way. There is nothing overwhelmingly epic in the story of Okonkwo, only that of a man trying to live according to his values in a world that insistently imposes its own.
