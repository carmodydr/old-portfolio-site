This contains a notes and notebooks around my exploration of complex systems.

Things I hope to contain within here:
 - network analysis and network growth
 - growth of cities, infrastructure
 - exploration of ideas within various books


Agent based modeling:
 - autonomous metabolism
 - energy storage, energy consumption
 - likelihood to make connections between agents
 - length of connection
 - energy transfer (or transfer of other characteristics) along connection
 - reproduction, inheritance of properties
 - brownian motion
