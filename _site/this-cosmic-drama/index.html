</center> <p>Not long before I finished my PhD thesis I had the opportunity to spend about two weeks touring around the south island of New Zealand on a bicycle. The beginning of the trip was spent mostly on the rainy West Coast, where my touring companion and I were more interested in finding sleeping accommodations that were warm and dry than in viewing the sky. There was one night, however, when we were camped out in Makarora, a small town of about 300 nestled in the mountains of the Southern Alps. At least 50km distant from any other town and shielded by high peaks, it offered wonderful viewing conditions of the night sky. From that vantage point we were able to see the constellation Crux, also known as the Southern Cross. We saw the sweep of the Milky Way and, just off the galactic plane, we saw a barely discernible smudge known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, referred to by the 10th century Persian astronomer Al Sufi as ‘the Sheep’, and which is actually a dwarf galaxy 160000 light years away, one of our own galaxy’s nearest neighbors. I felt close to the stars on that night, connected to them through every shared experience I’ve had of their majestic nightly display. It’s an experience that’s fading, however. Although the physical distances between the earth and the stars have not changed significantly in the lifetime of the human species, I often get the impression that the stars have nevertheless been steadily receding from our collective consciousness.</p> <p>In graduate school, my research was focused on modeling plasma physics processes in experimental fusion devices. Nuclear fusion - when light elements are combined to form heavier ones, accompanied by the release of tremendous amounts of energy - is the process that powers our sun, and every single star in the sky exists on the same principle.</p> <p>With the exception of certain deep sea creatures living near geothermal vents, all life on earth relies on the sun as an energy source, either directly or indirectly. This energy production process, the fusion of light elements into heavier ones, has only begun to be understood in the last hundred years. This was an idea first suggested by Arthur Eddington in 1920 and eventually made more rigorous by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. With this growing knowledge of the physical mechanisms taking place within the heart of our nearest star, the nature of other suns became better known. However, it seems to be one of the strange, tragic ironies of science and technology that in the same period of time that we have begun to understand the stars we have also begun to lose them.</p> <p>Immediately after I defended my dissertation I went to work at an astronomy camp about two hours outside of Los Angeles. To many this may sound like a terrible place for a camp devoted to astronomical observation, being so close to one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, but the night sky was dark enough to view planets, nebula, and even the streak of the Milky Way itself. Tucked away up in the San Bernardino mountains, above the wavering air of the inland empire and a mile closer to the emptiness of space than the Venice boardwalk, our small enclave was more than sufficient to provide a new experience of the universe to elementary school kids from down in the city lights. Our sky was nothing compared to the truly dark skies in the world, but it was enough to provide a shift in perspective, something that has really been the essential function of the stars for millennia.</p> <p>The history of mankind’s interactions with the stars stretches back beyond recorded history. Just as constant a presence as the sun or the moon, the presence of the stars has been etched into most major religions and many ancient cultures. Sophisticated astronomical tables and calculations originating with the Mayans over 700 years ago can be found in the Dresden Codex. Calendars and calculations attributable to the Babylonians exist even earlier than this. The Antikythera mechanism, dated to around 100 BC and the oldest known analogue computer, was likely used by the ancient Greeks to track important yearly events and perhaps aid in celestial navigation. The stars have served as navigational aids on both land and sea for millenia. Since before we had any inkling of their true nature, we have been using the stars to define our calendar and guide us from one place to another.</p> <p>The stars are ubiquitous, a constant presence in the night, but our knowledge of them has been limited by our eyesight and our ability to conjecture. It was less than five hundred years ago that people first started to seriously believe that the stars might be cosmic objects on par with the sun and the earth. Giordano Bruno was one of the first, in 1584, to suggest that those pinpoint lights in the night sky may be suns like our own and about which may orbit planets like our own. Building upon the Copernican notion of a heliocentric solar system, this was a revolutionary and radical idea, displacing our solar system from its throne of individuality and establishing it within the egalitarian context of an infinite universe. A few years after the publication of these ideas came Galileo, who brought telescopes and scientific observations to the subject. His original publication, the Starry Messenger, described the uneven surface of the moon, showed evidence of previously unseen stars in major constellations, and introduced the moons of Jupiter.</p> <p>300 hundred years later, with the birth of Edison’s electric light bulb in 1879, came the gradual diminishing role of the stars in night time pondering. Although versions of the electric light bulb existed previously, it was Edison’s ability to make it durable and long lasting, and market his invention, that made it a commercial success.</p> <p>It is easy to see why artificial light should be such a basic desire for many people. It eliminates the unknown things that lurk in the darkness. It enables a motivated and industrious person to extend their productive hours beyond the confines established by the passing of the sun. The limitations imposed by natural rhythms began to erode. This came at a crucial time. As our growing knowledge of the stars and the sun placed us as bit players within the vast drama of nature, our technological capabilities isolated us from it and allowed us to regain center stage.</p> <p>In the beginning of the 20th century the revolutionary theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity had begun paving the way for new scientifically established cosmologies. Improvements in telescope technology and observational techniques, such as photographic film and “blinking” exposures to detect movement, led to the detection of additional objects within our own solar system like Pluto and the asteroid belt. At roughly the same time, the electric lightbulb was finding its foothold in the world. The electrification of the United States occurred at a rapidly accelerating pace throughout the twentieth century. In 1930 less than 10% of rural areas were connected to electricity. 20 years later this number had jumped to 90%, thanks largely to the efforts of the Rural Electrification Administration.</p> <p>This electrification brought with it the efficiencies of modern technologies, but it also brought an increase in light pollution. Some communities took steps to protect against this encroachment. The town of Flagstaff, near to the Lowell observatory, passed some of the first light ordinances in 1958, striving to maintain the integrity of their night sky for research and tourism purposes.</p> <p>Astronomers have found it useful to introduce the Bortle scale, a way to talk about the degree of light pollution in an area. This scale ranges from 1, the darkest possible sky, to 9, which is for the inner city and at which point few or no stars can be seen. The Bortle scale, just like the various protections and restrictions placed around observatories, is primarily concerned with viewing conditions for astronomical research rather than the quotidian view of the night sky that someone might experience, but the loss of this experience might have it’s own important consequences.</p> <p>The growing extent of artificial light has driven our experiences of the stars out to the periphery of society, out to the empty and isolated places. This has in turn led to a sort of astro-tourism, where the stars are a novelty, an experience for vacations and get-aways. Similarly, telescopes and observatories have transitioned further and further away from populated areas as our relationship to the stars have become more and more distant and technical.</p> <p>The stars provide much more than points of reference for technical observation, however. In many ways they provide fundamental shifts in our self awareness, continuous Copernican revolutions that define our relationship to a world larger than our individual selves or even our species. Our sun is one of many stars on the edge of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and the Milky Way is itself one of many galaxies. Our galaxy is not overly special, our star is not overly special, and even our planet seems to be losing its uniqueness, as exoplanet discoveries with the new Kepler telescope are revealing.</p> <p>There seems to be a consistent theme in the development of the human species: a recognition of what we are losing only as we begin to understand it, falling in line with the tropical rainforest and the coral reef. It is important to remember what it is that we are losing. Rather than just a laboratory for astrophysics, the stars are a source of inspiration and a jumping point for wonder. They are the backdrop for the cosmic drama that is life on earth. They are a link to a universe much greater than ourselves and are a way for us to recognize the ways in which we may become greater than what we are. In the words of astronomer-philosopher Carl Sagan, “Much of human history can, I think, be described as a gradual and sometimes painful liberation from provincialism, the emerging awareness that there is more to the world than was generally believed by our ancestors.” It was Sagan’s belief that the study of astronomy served to help avoid the kind of provincialism that arises when a group of people is too focused on the narrow sphere of the world (or universe) it inhabits.</p> <p>The loss of the night sky has not gone completely unnoticed or uncontested. Near to my campground in Makarora was the Aoraki Dark sky preserve, home to the Tekapo observatory. Designated by the International Dark-Sky Association as a dark sky preserve, it maintains certain strict guidelines about the types of development that may take place. I, for one, greatly appreciate these efforts. It is an attempt to preserve a piece of the earth in which we may experience the same kind of night sky that our ancestors did millennia ago.</p> <p>Unlike the wild places of the earth, the stars themselves need no protection from us. What needs to be preserved is our own experience and the connection that the stars have had to the development of our species. Have the stars finished revealing to us their meaning? Is there no more role for them to play? Unlikely. We have lived with the stars for millennia, and without them for less than a century. On the time scales of human civilization, the stars are unchanging. And yet, they have been such a powerful catalyst for human beings, directly responsible for some of the most important elements of self-knowledge we have. This is a connection that should not be forgotten.</p> <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#astronomy" title="Pages tagged astronomy" class="tag"><span class="term">astronomy</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#technology" title="Pages tagged technology" class="tag"><span class="term">technology</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#progress" title="Pages tagged progress" class="tag"><span class="term">progress</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#environment" title="Pages tagged environment" class="tag"><span class="term">environment</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Like</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <!-- Asynchronous Google Analytics snippet --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-50791294-1', 'auto'); ga('require', 'linkid', 'linkid.js'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'dan'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
