The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (who refers to himself as NNT), spent years as a trader on Wall Street and thus considers himself an empiricist wise in the ways of the real world.</p> <p>The primary thesis of <em>Black Swan</em> centers around the existence of important, unpredictable events NNT calls Black Swans. The occurrence of unpredictable events should not come as a surprise to anyone, however it is not only the unpredictability of an event that makes it a Black Swan but also that it has considerable consequences for the system it affects and, crucially, it is often retrospectively explained in such a way that it seems entirely predictable.</p> <p>The world is full of such things, inherently unpredictable events that play fundamental roles in the evolution of the systems they affect. A key example given by NNT is that the ten largest one-day moves in the stock market account for half of its current value. These kinds of jumps are not included in typical stochastic models, emerging instead from the complicated dynamics of the global economy, but they nevertheless play an unignorable role in the outcome of the market.</p> <p>This hits on a key theme that NNT stresses again and again. Statistical fluctuations and simple regressions of the kind most often treated by financial models capture the boring, predictable behavior of a system but totally ignore the existence of intrinsic and fundamental phenomena that may have major effects. The true danger of Black Swans is realized when they affect systems in which there are people trying to make predictions and assess risk using tools inappropriate to the task. This exists within the realms of financial trading and econometrics, where NNT asserts that models of the world formulated by many social scientists and economists handle randomness and uncertainty in entirely unrealistic ways. Too many people are in love with Platonic idealizations of the world and the interactions taking place within it. Events that occur outside these idealizations are seen as outliers or flukes, rather than as inherent elements of the larger system.</p> <p>Throughout the book NNT wages a particularly focused crusade against Gaussian statistics, in which large deviations from the mean are extremely unlikely, and pushes instead for the use of Mandelbrotian (also referred to as fractal or power law) statistics. Power law statistics are scale invariant, meaning that events of different magnitudes maintain the same relative frequency and large scale events are much more common than in the Gaussian mindset. Gaussian statistics are most applicable, NNT argues, in very specific or localized realms, such as the distribution of heights of a population, but not in more complex systems such as financial markets. To use them in such scenarios is misleading and ignorant and introduces unnecessary (and unforeseen) levels of risk.</p> <p>What is one to do in the face of inherent uncertainty and unpredictability? His advice: maximize exposure to the gains induced by positive Black Swans, minimize exposure to the losses imposed by negative Black Swans. Recognize the existence of unknown unknowns. Put more effort into preparedness rather than mitigation.</p> <p><em>Black Swan</em> is quite readable, and despite being predominantly concerned with statistics and risk assessment it deliberately avoids the use of equations or the dry language of textbooks. Instead it opts for the popular science approach, which employs the use of entertaining anecdotes and wraps complex ideas within simple metaphors like “Black Swan” or “Extremistan”.</p> <p>As with most popular science books there is bound to be some oversimplification, which in the case of <em>Black Swan</em> appears in the dichotomy between Gaussian and power law approaches to risk assessment. This apparent dichotomy is reinforced throughout the book as opposing pairs: Mediocristan/Extremistan, Dr. John/Fat Tony, Gaussian/Mandelbrotian. Although useful for making a point, this explicit categorization and binning of the world is bound to obscure the details.</p> <p>Coming from a background in physics, I have been steeped in the Gaussian mindset. There is plenty within physics that can be attributed to Gaussian mathematics, such as the thermodynamically averaged motion of particles within a fluid governed by statistical mechanics, just as there are realms in which power law statistics emerge, such as the turbulence produced by a mixing fluid.</p> <p>Much of NNT’s consternation with social scientists is when they bring the tools of more Platonic fields like physics or mathematics into the realm of messy real world applications, but even within physics, which often deals with explicitly idealized and simplified systems, there are topics of study that range between the simple and the complex. It is always important to recognize where on this spectrum a problem lies and be able to address the full complexity of real world systems.</p> <p>The ideas of <em>Black Swan</em> are interesting and well-articulated, but one thing that I found distracting about the book was the constant deviation from the ideas to discuss the character of the people who held opposing viewpoints. NNT states that someone resorts to ad hominem attacks if they can’t find anything within a person’s idea worth attacking, but he himself can’t resist attacking both, characterizing the purveyors of Gaussian statistics as boring, unimaginative “empty suits”. It is obvious that he doesn’t consider the real problem within econometrics to be the tools being used but instead the people who, in his mind, foolishly and bewildering rely on such tools. The real purpose of <em>Black Swan</em> is to call these people out, make them accountable, and to put them on the defensive.</p> <p>Although the ideas of power law statistics are not new to me, NNT presents them in a way that shifts my interpretation of the world, and any book that can do that is definitely worth reading.</p> <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#book" title="Pages tagged book" class="tag"><span class="term">book</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#review" title="Pages tagged review" class="tag"><span class="term">review</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#uncertainty" title="Pages tagged uncertainty" class="tag"><span class="term">uncertainty</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#probability" title="Pages tagged probability" class="tag"><span class="term">probability</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#complexity" title="Pages tagged complexity" class="tag"><span class="term">complexity</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#taleb" title="Pages tagged taleb" class="tag"><span class="term">taleb</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Like</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <!-- Asynchronous Google Analytics snippet --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-50791294-1', 'auto'); ga('require', 'linkid', 'linkid.js'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'dan'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
