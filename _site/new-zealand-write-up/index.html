<!-- /.entry-reading-time --> <a class="btn zoombtn" href="http://localhost:4000/posts/"> <i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i> </a> </div> <p>Back in January of 2014 I took a trip out to the South Island of New Zealand to meet up with a friend and ride bikes down the west coast. Shortly after that I put together a write up of the trip, but it has since been sitting on my hard drive, collecting virtual dust. Rather than continue trying to work it into something more respectable, I’ve decided to just post it and move on. There is a companion interactive map available on <a href="/newzealand">the project page</a>.</p> <center> <img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7294/12384549513_9643830484_z_d.jpg" alt="Myself, standing with rented bike along the West Coast."> <caption align="bottom">Myself, standing with rented bike along the West Coast.</caption> </center> <hr> <p>There is something strangely alluring about New Zealand. Nestled in the southern-most reaches of the globe, it is distant and sparsely populated, offering empty places and stunning views. Populated by human beings only since the 13th century, there is a fresh kind of wildness to it. The first Europeans to settle the land arrived in the early 19th century. In the 1874 book ‘Crusts: A Settler’s Fare Due South’, Laurence Kennaway declared about landing on the South Island, “That man must have a strong, cold heart, who in stepping from a ship’s boat into a really new country, does not feel bewildered, and something desolate.” But, for an American, that bewilderment and desolation is offset by the safety and security of its English speaking and largely western culture. The result is something both exotic and familiar.</p> <p>I arrived in Christchurch on a beautiful and sunny day in January, in the middle of the southern summer. Upon my arrival at the airport I met my friend and cycling partner, Jake, who, like me, is a physics graduate student and eager adventurer. He had just spent the previous month down at the South Pole, where his research experiment is based, and I can guess that a month effectively confined to the indoors has left him starved for physical activity and the sensations of the natural world. I’d just come from Madison, WI, where we both lived, a place so beset by a harsh winter and attacks of the ‘polar vortex’ that it had from time to time been colder in Madison than in Antarctica. We were both thrilled at the prospect of getting outside again. We delayed the start of our journey in order to allow a few things to catch up: my luggage, which had missed a connection in Hawaii, and my body’s sense of time, which was itself lost somewhere around Samoa. We therefore had about two days to spend meandering around town while waiting for both.</p> <p>Christchurch, our home base for the trip and New Zealand’s third largest city, had not yet recovered from a set of powerful earthquakes that shook it back in 2010 and 2011. The city center was a scattered collection of damaged buildings and empty lots, interspersed with the occasional functional store or restaurant. There was a definite post-apocalyptic feel to the air that was only enhanced by elements of a ‘pop-up’ city, such as a mall constructed out of brightly colored shipping containers. The incomplete city left little to do other than wander and wait.</p> <p>While waiting, we took a city bus out to the outskirts of town, to the bike travel agency Natural High, to pick up our rented bicycles. Our rides for the trip were two Specialized Sirrus touring bikes, each equipped with bottle cages and a rear rack. As we were filling out the paperwork, a cheery, blonde-haired Kiwi name Sandra asked us about our trip. We told her of our plans to head out towards the West Coast, and she replied with a brief warning of ‘it’s a bit hilly out that way’. We brushed off her concern with the conceit of seasoned flatlanders. We returned to the hostel to find that my lost luggage has dutifully found us, and we were all set to begin.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/jake_map.jpg" alt="Jake preps his bike at the rental shop."> <caption align="bottom">Jake preps his bike at the rental shop.</caption> </center> <p>The next day we set out from Christchurch towards 73, the Great Alpine Highway, which would take us up and over Arthur’s Pass and put us on the shores of the Tasman Sea on the West Coast of the island. Our companion for the ride was Nigel Rushton’s ‘Pedaller’s Paradise’, a thin cycling guide book that aims “to inform the users while still leaving something to discover”. The book contained elevation profiles, distances between towns, and a variety of official and unofficial information on food and accommodation to be found along the way.</p> <p>Despite traversing one of the main roads that leads from the east coast to the west, car traffic was relatively light and intermittent, and it was not uncommon for us to have the road entirely to ourselves. The roads had no shoulder, but when cars pass they generally did so leaving us plenty of room. At first the road out of town offered little more than farms and pastures that would not have been so out of place back home in Wisconsin. Switch out sheep for cows and you would be hard pressed to find a difference. Although I was thrilled to be out on a bike and out of the winter, this was not the New Zealand the post cards had promised.</p> <p>In Sheffield, about 35 miles from our start, we encountered the first town since leaving Christchurch. This included, importantly, the Sheffield Pie Shop. The bakery offered a variety of savory pies and sweet treats, including the cream donut, an obscene pastry the size of a hamburger and more part cream than donut. I would never have expected to encounter sugar and butter in such quantities anywhere outside of the American South. It contained enough calories to make a significant dent in the hunger of a touring cyclist.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/sheffield_pie.jpg" alt="Sheffield Pie Shop."> <caption align="bottom">Sheffield Pie Shop.</caption> </center> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/cream_donut.jpg" alt="The obscene cream donut."> <caption align="bottom">The obscene cream donut.</caption> </center> <p>Beyond Sheffield we began to encounter the foothills of the Southern Alps, precursors to the mountains that were ahead. The grade of the road began a steadily increasing turn upward. This was Porter’s Pass, our sudden, harsh welcome to the mountains. Shrouded in fog and drizzling mist, the road up to the top of the pass was unending and unyielding, presenting us with no views beside the short section of the road ahead of us. After an interminable amount of time, we arrived at the top, a full 50 miles further and 3000 feet higher than the start of our day in Christchurch.</p> <p>The other side of Porter’s sent us sailing through the mist at speeds that mocked the struggle we had had on the ascent. In the blink of an eye we flew past gorges and cliffsides and out into the sunshine of the high plateau beyond the pass. Soon we were at Castle Hill, a wide grass valley strewn with enormous limestone boulders. The boulders make it a top destination for rock climbers, and with the monolithic serenity of their placement in a great sweeping landscape, I had no trouble believing that the Dalai Lama once called this place a spiritual center of the universe.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/jake_castle.jpg" alt="Jake, atop a boulder at Castle Hill."> <caption align="bottom">Jake, atop a boulder at Castle Hill.</caption> </center> <p>We decided to camp only a few miles down the road at the Craigieburn campground. While preparing dinner we discovered that although we remembered both food and a camp stove, we had somehow managed to forget cutlery. Few people in the world are as resourceful as a hungry cyclist, however, and we managed to fashion useful implements out of tire levers and half the shell of an avocado. Legs tired and bellies full, we fell asleep to the sound of a nearby stream.</p> <p>Morning arrived and brought with it a tale of disaster from the night. My water bottles, which had been located among other gear outside the tent, were missing. I located them twenty feet away, both with half-dollar sized holes gnawed through them. We found the camp stove a further twenty feet beyond that, the plastic casing that housed it with a similarly sized hole, although the stove itself was undamaged. Both the culprit and the motive for this sabotage were nowhere to be found, so we had no choice but to pack up our things and continue along.</p> <p>Twenty-five miles beyond the campground was the town of Arthur’s Pass, a tourist stop with a few shops and cafes before the actual pass itself. We grabbed some food and I used this opportunity to buy a couple of sports drinks to replace my lost water bottles. We also managed to surreptiously alleviate our cutlery deficit.</p> <p>In addition to tourists, Arthur’s Pass seemed to be overrun by kea, New Zealand’s alpine parrot. It is a large and dull-green bird and apparently fearless when it comes to stealing food off the plates of visitors. Numerous signs warn not to feed them, but this did not stop most people.</p> <p>We continued on from the town and encountered the start of the climb up Arthur’s Pass a few miles down the road. The ride over Arthur’s Pass was not nearly so bad as Porter’s was. Before we think we’re even half way, we were at the top.</p> <p>Beyond the pass we had a good stretch of downhill that carried us past alpine meadows and through the town of Jackson, where a restaurant mentioned by the guidebook appeared to have been closed for some time. Further down the road we decided to stop for a pizza at the hotel in Kumara and then venture onward, assured by a local, and backed by our guidebook, that there was camping in Kumara Junction, just six miles ahead. Once there we found, to our chagrin, nothing that resembled a campsite, and so we were forced to continue onward. The road hit the coast and we left the Alpine Highway, turning south on Route 6, the West Coast Highway.</p> <p>With less than an hour left of sunset and at least an hour and a half until Hokitika, the next town, it seemed increasingly likely that we would have to either bike through the dark or spend a night camped out alongside the road. We stopped in at a B&amp;B to ask about camping in the yard, but all we got was a polite rejection. Luckily we soon found a campground that was virtually empty, and as the sun was setting we made camp, the end to a long day.</p> <p>We took it leisurely the following morning, breaking camp slowly and taking a short five mile ride into the town of Hokitika. A beach town, Hokitika is a tourist hotspot and home to a thriving jade jewelry industry. With a population of 3000, it is also large enough to support a library, and so we took the opportunity to grab some Internet and fire off updates to friends and family. After this bit of reconnection with the outside world, we hopped on the bikes again and rode out of town.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/hokitika.jpg" alt="The coastal town of Hokitika."> <caption align="bottom">The coastal town of Hokitika.</caption> </center> <p>About 15 miles later we arrived in Ross. Although we had only travelled 20 miles for the day, our two previous days, 70 and 85 miles, had worn us out a bit, and a sky that looked like impending rain only increased the argument for staying. We decided to stop for the night and, furthermore, to shell out about 15 NZD each for a room. We settled ourselves into the room, showered, and made our way to the bar. No sooner had we settled in next to the fireplace with a pitcher of beer than it started to pour outside - ‘pissing down’ in the words of the bartender. There was no doubt in either of our minds that we had made the right decision.</p> <p>For the next several days we settled into a much more regular pattern, generally covering about 50 miles a day. The West Coast is known for its rain and its hills. Part of a temperate rainforest, the trees around us rung with the clicking of cicadas, and enormous ferns sprouted from the ground as if we were passing through prehistoric territory, unchanged since the Cretaceous period. The hills popped up under us in a persistent and staccato rhythm.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/jake_green.jpg" alt="The verdant coastal road."> <caption align="bottom">The verdant coastal road.</caption> </center> <p>The highway was marked by a smattering of small towns, all spread about 20-30 miles apart. We passed through Pukekura, home to the Road Kill Cafe and virtually nothing else. The menu advertised possum pies, but a posted sign announced that due to new restrictions the sale of pies made from wild-caught possum had been forbidden. I was only mildly disappointed.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/gopro_self.jpg" alt="Jake and I, somewhere along the West Coast."> <caption align="bottom">Jake and I, somewhere along the West Coast.</caption> </center> <p>Beyond that was Whataroa, and although it had little by way of attractions, it did have a bar with a fireplace and a kitchen with hot food. With a sky that once again looked like approaching rain, this was more than enough to hold us. We pitched our tent on a patch of grass by a sheep pasture and retreated into the bar while the first few drops of rain began to fall. We had once again made the right decision.</p> <p>The next day, our fifth day of cycling since leaving Christchurch, we encountered the twin towns of Franz Josef and Fox Glacier, each a tourist hotspot for nearby glaciers. Helicopters flew constant tours overhead, carrying visitors from town to glacier and back.</p> <p>The next town after Fox Glacier was Haast, about 120 km further south, and there was hardly anything between the two besides the road and the landscape that surrounded it. This also meant that there were hardly any campgrounds, which meant we were on the lookout for some place to take advantage of New Zealand’s liberal rules on freedom camping. These rules essentially allowed for camping on any conservation land unless otherwise explicitly restricted. Many people chose to do this in the ubiquitous camper vans that streamed up and down the highway, just pulling off the road and staying overnight in a trail head parking lot. With our bikes and our tent we had to be a little more selective in finding an overnight location.</p> <p>The opportunity came 40 km south of Fox Glacier when the road took a turn to bring us near the sea at Bruce’s Bay. There was a long stretch of sandy beach covered with scattered driftwood. We set up camp amid the driftwood on a high plateau that looked like it hasn’t been flooded in a long while.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/bruce_bay.jpg" alt="At Bruce's Bay we made camp amid driftwood and sandflies."> <caption align="bottom">At Bruce's Bay we made camp amid driftwood and sandflies.</caption> </center> <p>It was at this campsite that we truly encountered the ferocity of the sandfly. It is sometimes said that New Zealand contains no natural predators. This is a lie. The sandfly, a small biting black fly, exists in enormous, unconquerable numbers. I became convinced that a swarm of them would be capable of devouring an entire person in a matter of minutes, like minuscule airborne piranha. I tried not to bat too many of them into the pot of rice and beans that we were preparing for dinner.</p> <p>While we cooked, two young children approached us from a nearby camper van. The children, a girl of about 10 and a boy of about 7, scrambled over the driftwood and approached our campsite. After brief introductions, they pointed over to the beach where their father was building a bonfire and invited us over. After finishing up dinner we took them up on their invitation. The family was from Christchurch, and over roasted marshmallows and bottles of beer we talked about our trip and theirs, about America and about New Zealand. They told us a little bit about the aftermath of the quakes, and how most of the life of the city migrated out to the suburbs, leaving the downtown area in its current state. Eventually it was time for the kids to get to bed, so Jake and I said good night and sat for a bit longer while the crackling driftwood fire died down.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/bonfire.jpg" alt="A bonfire and beers."> <caption align="bottom">A bonfire and beers.</caption> </center> <p>The next morning we said goodbye to our new friends and set out on the road. An uneventful 50 miles of riding took us to Haast.</p> <p>In Haast we checked into a hostel and then went to dinner at the Hard Antler, a place that, like the hotel in Ross, would have been quite at home in the north woods of Wisconsin. I wa surprised to see a large taxidermy moose head on the wall, and even more surprised to find that it had been shot in New Zealand. An article on the wall told me that, introduced in the early 20th century for game purposes, it had been decades since a live moose has been seen on the island, but hair and feces recently found suggested that a few might still roam the woods.</p> <p>The forecast for the following day called for rainstorms, and so we planned to take a day off rather than take on the curving and potentially treacherous mountain road.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/jake_coast.jpg" alt="Jake, somewhere along the West Coast."> <caption align="bottom">Jake, somewhere along the West Coast.</caption> </center> <p>The following day brought the rain. It was not as much as we had been fearing, although the sheet metal roof over the hostel acted like an enormous amplifier for the weather, turning a light drizzle into a downpour and an errant breeze into a hurricane force gale.</p> <p>There was internet there, but it cost about a dollar for 10 minutes, so I spent most of the day finishing Jule’s Verne’s ‘The Mysterious Island’ and wandering back and forth between the hostel and the nearby convenience store.</p> <p>Late in the day the last of the rain rolled through town and left in its wake a glorious rainbow that stretched from horizon to horizon and framed hills turned golden from the setting sun. It was a mark of good things to come. The following day we departed under a sky devoid of clouds, the first time in the last week we’d had uninhibited sunshine.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/rainbow.jpg" alt="The sun follows the rain at Haast."> <caption align="bottom">The sun follows the rain at Haast.</caption> </center> <p>A large part of the elevation gain from Haast was done through the Gates of Haast, a deep-set rocky gorge where the land fell steeply away from the road to a churning series of whitewater rapids below. The guidebook showed an elevation profile for this portion of our route that looked more like a vertical wall than a road. It is a climb that had been looming in my mind over the previous several days.</p> <p>Unlike the mist shrouded climb of our first day, the sun was out in force, warming our backs and shining benevolently on the surrounding snowy peaks and forested hills. We were more resilient as well, and although the climb was long, we easily settled into a rhythm and made our way up.</p> <p>From the top of the climb it was an easy rolling road that carried us to Makarora. We arrived there to find a lodge that served beer, cheeseburgers, and milkshakes, and on a wooden porch that promised a mountain sunset we found ourselves once again being pulled to lock up our bikes for the day and kick back. As abundant the joys of cycling new terrain were, they faced stiff competition against the prospect of a shower and a hot meal. This is one of the things that sets cycle touring apart from something like backpacking. Despite the physical exhaustion and the deprivations of traveling light, civilization’s amenities are almost always close at hand.</p> <p>The clear skies that followed us throughout the day stuck around for the night, and I was able to see the stars of the southern sky. It is often said that traveling offers new perspectives, and this is no more true than when you have a whole new half of the universe open for you. From this small town nestled in the mountains I could see countless stars that, though billions of years old, were fresh to my eyes.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/makarora.jpg" alt="The lonely road out of Makarora."> <caption align="bottom">The lonely road out of Makarora.</caption> </center> <p>The following morning we continued onward, and shortly after leaving Makarora the road found its way to Lake Wanaka, one of several large lakes in the central Otago region. The road followed the shoreline for several miles, eventually crossing over to neighboring Lake Hawea before weaving back around and ending in the town of Wanaka.</p> <p>We had started with dreams of completing a full loop back to Christchurch, but the days that remained until the bikes were due to be returned and the distance left to travel simply did not work out in our favor. As the biggest town before Christchurch, Wanaka was the only place where we could be sure of catching a bus that could carry us and our bikes. We made the arrangements. Two days later we were on the bus being carried to our trip’s conclusion.</p> <p>From the bus window I stared out at the landscape that we would have been biking through, imagining what it would’ve felt like. There were rolling hills, slow-going and tough on the quads and the lungs. There were long sections of road that looked hot and dry and barren; those would have taken some planning to be sure of having water. And in Tekapo there was the surreal blue water of the glacier-fed lake, the 12,000 ft Aoraki / Mount Cook in the background. That would have been a nice place to sit in the sun, falling asleep for a while, counting sheep and miles until I made it back home.</p> <center> <img src="/assets/img/newzealand/tekapo.jpg" alt="Azure waters and the snow-capped peak of Aoraki / Mt.
