One of the main points that Curtin makes is that effective conservation policy is predicated on the capacity of individuals and organizations to learn, both from other entities associated with the land and/or involved in the process of conservation, as well as from the process itself and its generated effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, on this process of learning he says, “Learning emerges from the interaction of individuals and organizations and the social and ecological systems within which they are embedded.” So learning is emergent, a core idea of complex systems, and this kind of complex emergence is further stressed when he writes that learning is “a self-organized process in which the more information is available, the greater the potential for success.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curtin uses this perspective to discuss underlying cognitive processes and to introduce something called the ‘Santiago theory of cognition’, which states that “cognition is the very process of life, including perception, emotion, and behavior.” This comes across as a very broad and all-encompassing statement, and I was curious to know more about the Santiago theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named after Santiago, Chile, where the main proponents of this theory were based, the essential idea is that cognition - the act of thinking - is less about what goes on in a particular brain and more about the interactions between that brain and its environment. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago's_theory_of_cognition&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “Cognition is considered as the ability of adaptation in a certain environment,” or in other words, a system that adapts to overcome problems arising in its environment is in a very real sense ‘thinking’ its way through these problems, whether or not that system is a single brain or a collection of individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all interesting, but it seems very abstract and theoretical for a discussion on conservation. What is Curtin’s point? His point is that “successful transformations toward effective science and policy at large scales tend to emerge from informal networks that help facilitate information flows, identify knowledge gaps, and creates nodes of expertise.” In other words, we shouldn’t necessarily expect to think our way through hard policy problems, or that effective policy can be generated by a few minds acting in isolation. Rather, the goal should be to construct a distributed mind, one that exists as a flexible network of problem solvers that take autonomous action and explore the solution space, communicate openly with one another, and slowly generate consensus to move in a more informal way towards a successful outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecology" /><category term="complexity" /><category term="cognition" /><summary type="html">Successful transformations toward effective science and policy at large scales tend to emerge from informal networks that help facilitate information flows, identify knowledge gaps, and creates nodes of expertise.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This Cosmic Drama</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This Cosmic Drama" /><published>2017-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/this-cosmic-drama/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/nz_stars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long before I finished my PhD thesis I had the opportunity to spend about two weeks touring around the south island of New Zealand on a bicycle. The beginning of the trip was spent mostly on the rainy West Coast, where my touring companion and I were more interested in finding sleeping accommodations that were warm and dry than in viewing the sky. There was one night, however, when we were camped out in Makarora, a small town of about 300 nestled in the mountains of the Southern Alps. At least 50km distant from any other town and shielded by high peaks, it offered wonderful viewing conditions of the night sky. From that vantage point we were able to see the constellation Crux, also known as the Southern Cross. We saw the sweep of the Milky Way and, just off the galactic plane, we saw a barely discernible smudge known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, referred to by the 10th century Persian astronomer Al Sufi as ‘the Sheep’, and which is actually a dwarf galaxy 160000 light years away, one of our own galaxy’s nearest neighbors. I felt close to the stars on that night, connected to them through every shared experience I’ve had of their majestic nightly display. It’s an experience that’s fading, however. Although the physical distances between the earth and the stars have not changed significantly in the lifetime of the human species, I often get the impression that the stars have nevertheless been steadily receding from our collective consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In graduate school, my research was focused on modeling plasma physics processes in experimental fusion devices. Nuclear fusion - when light elements are combined to form heavier ones, accompanied by the release of tremendous amounts of energy - is the process that powers our sun, and every single star in the sky exists on the same principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of certain deep sea creatures living near geothermal vents, all life on earth relies on the sun as an energy source, either directly or indirectly. This energy production process, the fusion of light elements into heavier ones, has only begun to be understood in the last hundred years. This was an idea first suggested by Arthur Eddington in 1920 and eventually made more rigorous by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. With this growing knowledge of the physical mechanisms taking place within the heart of our nearest star, the nature of other suns became better known. However, it seems to be one of the strange, tragic ironies of science and technology that in the same period of time that we have begun to understand the stars we have also begun to lose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after I defended my dissertation I went to work at an astronomy camp about two hours outside of Los Angeles. To many this may sound like a terrible place for a camp devoted to astronomical observation, being so close to one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, but the night sky was dark enough to view planets, nebula, and even the streak of the Milky Way itself. Tucked away up in the San Bernardino mountains, above the wavering air of the inland empire and a mile closer to the emptiness of space than the Venice boardwalk, our small enclave was more than sufficient to provide a new experience of the universe to elementary school kids from down in the city lights. Our sky was nothing compared to the truly dark skies in the world, but it was enough to provide a shift in perspective, something that has really been the essential function of the stars for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of mankind’s interactions with the stars stretches back beyond recorded history. Just as constant a presence as the sun or the moon, the presence of the stars has been etched into most major religions and many ancient cultures. Sophisticated astronomical tables and calculations originating with the Mayans over 700 years ago can be found in the Dresden Codex. Calendars and calculations attributable to the Babylonians exist even earlier than this. The Antikythera mechanism, dated to around 100 BC and the oldest known analogue computer, was likely used by the ancient Greeks to track important yearly events and perhaps aid in celestial navigation. The stars have served as navigational aids on both land and sea for millenia. Since before we had any inkling of their true nature, we have been using the stars to define our calendar and guide us from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars are ubiquitous, a constant presence in the night, but our knowledge of them has been limited by our eyesight and our ability to conjecture. It was less than five hundred years ago that people first started to seriously believe that the stars might be cosmic objects on par with the sun and the earth. Giordano Bruno was one of the first, in 1584, to suggest that those pinpoint lights in the night sky may be suns like our own and about which may orbit planets like our own. Building upon the Copernican notion of a heliocentric solar system, this was a revolutionary and radical idea, displacing our solar system from its throne of individuality and establishing it within the egalitarian context of an infinite universe. A few years after the publication of these ideas came Galileo, who brought telescopes and scientific observations to the subject. His original publication, the Starry Messenger, described the uneven surface of the moon, showed evidence of previously unseen stars in major constellations, and introduced the moons of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;300 hundred years later, with the birth of Edison’s electric light bulb in 1879, came the gradual diminishing role of the stars in night time pondering. Although versions of the electric light bulb existed previously, it was Edison’s ability to make it durable and long lasting, and market his invention, that made it a commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see why artificial light should be such a basic desire for many people. It eliminates the unknown things that lurk in the darkness. It enables a motivated and industrious person to extend their productive hours beyond the confines established by the passing of the sun. The limitations imposed by natural rhythms began to erode. This came at a crucial time. As our growing knowledge of the stars and the sun placed us as bit players within the vast drama of nature, our technological capabilities isolated us from it and allowed us to regain center stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the 20th century the revolutionary theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity had begun paving the way for new scientifically established cosmologies. Improvements in telescope technology and observational techniques, such as photographic film and “blinking” exposures to detect movement, led to the detection of additional objects within our own solar system like Pluto and the asteroid belt. At roughly the same time, the electric lightbulb was finding its foothold in the world. The electrification of the United States occurred at a rapidly accelerating pace throughout the twentieth century. In 1930 less than 10% of rural areas were connected to electricity. 20 years later this number had jumped to 90%, thanks largely to the efforts of the Rural Electrification Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This electrification brought with it the efficiencies of modern technologies, but it also brought an increase in light pollution. Some communities took steps to protect against this encroachment. The town of Flagstaff, near to the Lowell observatory, passed some of the first light ordinances in 1958, striving to maintain the integrity of their night sky for research and tourism purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have found it useful to introduce the Bortle scale, a way to talk about the degree of light pollution in an area. This scale ranges from 1, the darkest possible sky, to 9, which is for the inner city and at which point few or no stars can be seen. The Bortle scale, just like the various protections and restrictions placed around observatories, is primarily concerned with viewing conditions for astronomical research rather than the quotidian view of the night sky that someone might experience, but the loss of this experience might have it’s own important consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing extent of artificial light has driven our experiences of the stars out to the periphery of society, out to the empty and isolated places. This has in turn led to a sort of astro-tourism, where the stars are a novelty, an experience for vacations and get-aways. Similarly, telescopes and observatories have transitioned further and further away from populated areas as our relationship to the stars have become more and more distant and technical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars provide much more than points of reference for technical observation, however. In many ways they provide fundamental shifts in our self awareness, continuous Copernican revolutions that define our relationship to a world larger than our individual selves or even our species. Our sun is one of many stars on the edge of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and the Milky Way is itself one of many galaxies. Our galaxy is not overly special, our star is not overly special, and even our planet seems to be losing its uniqueness, as exoplanet discoveries with the new Kepler telescope are revealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a consistent theme in the development of the human species: a recognition of what we are losing only as we begin to understand it, falling in line with the tropical rainforest and the coral reef. It is important to remember what it is that we are losing. Rather than just a laboratory for astrophysics, the stars are a source of inspiration and a jumping point for wonder. They are the backdrop for the cosmic drama that is life on earth. They are a link to a universe much greater than ourselves and are a way for us to recognize the ways in which we may become greater than what we are.
In the words of astronomer-philosopher Carl Sagan, “Much of human history can, I think, be described as a gradual and sometimes painful liberation from provincialism, the emerging awareness that there is more to the world than was generally believed by our ancestors.” It was Sagan’s belief that the study of astronomy served to help avoid the kind of provincialism that arises when a group of people is too focused on the narrow sphere of the world (or universe) it inhabits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of the night sky has not gone completely unnoticed or uncontested. Near to my campground in Makarora was the Aoraki Dark sky preserve, home to the Tekapo observatory. Designated by the International Dark-Sky Association as a dark sky preserve, it maintains certain strict guidelines about the types of development that may take place. I, for one, greatly appreciate these efforts. It is an attempt to preserve a piece of the earth in which we may experience the same kind of night sky that our ancestors did millennia ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the wild places of the earth, the stars themselves need no protection from us. What needs to be preserved is our own experience and the connection that the stars have had to the development of our species. Have the stars finished revealing to us their meaning? Is there no more role for them to play? Unlikely. We have lived with the stars for millennia, and without them for less than a century. On the time scales of human civilization, the stars are unchanging. And yet, they have been such a powerful catalyst for human beings, directly responsible for some of the most important elements of self-knowledge we have. This is a connection that should not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="astronomy" /><category term="technology" /><category term="progress" /><category term="environment" /><summary type="html">The stars have been an important catalyst for the development of the human species.

&lt;p&gt;Life and entropy are fundamentally linked, an idea touched upon by several books I’ve had in my queue recently. In his book &lt;em&gt;Darwin’s Dangerous Idea&lt;/em&gt;, Daniel Dennet explores the algorithmic processes that have lead to the emergence of life and the growth of complex organisms, and in this discussion arises the need to define life and set boundaries for what differentiates it from the rest of the inanimate world. Entropy plays a key role in setting these boundaries (a topic partially explored in Schrodinger’s &lt;em&gt;What is Life?&lt;/em&gt;), leading James Lovelock to declare that in the search for extraterrestrial life we must be on the lookout for “an entropy reduction, since this must be a general characteristic of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;What Technology Wants&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin Kelly extends many of the algorithmic ideas about the growth of complexity within the biosphere to include the technosphere as well (what Kelly calls the &lt;strong&gt;technium&lt;/strong&gt;). He also gives many pages of thought to the notion of negative entropy, dubbed &lt;strong&gt;exotropy&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the reversal of disorder that Lovelock declared to be a fundamentally distinguishing characteristic of life. For both life and the technium, this local reduction in entropy comes at the expense of a global increase. In the words of biochemist Albert Lehninger, “Living organisms preserve their internal order by taking from their surroundings free energy, in the form of nutrients or sunlight, and returning to their surroundings an equal amount of energy as heat and entropy.”A living organism survives by taking structured energy in the world around it and producing less structured waste energy, in the process using this transformation to repair and possibly grow itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a physicist I want to be rigorous about the use of entropy, a topic that is often misunderstood and misrepresented even among physicists (even and especially myself). The original definition of entropy was formulated in the context of closed systems at statistical equilibrium, and it was given a rigorous definition in terms of the number of microscopic configurations available to describe a given macroscopic state. It can be quite a leap to use this idea to describe what is taking place in an arbitrary complex, interconnected system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, the idea of entropy seems to apply to the world we see around us, in which there is a constant battle between order and disorder, organization and chaos. We recognize that it takes energy to keep things together when the natural tendency seems to be for everything to fall apart. When discussing the dispersal of gas in a closed room, entropy is a well formulated physical concept. Does it maintain some kind of rigor at the level of human beings, or is it just a useful metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, I want to set aside the question of rigor and focus on the value of the metaphor. We can intuitively grasp the tendency of the universe (or the world, or ourselves) towards chaos, just as we can see the effort required to maintain our lives and the world around us. Maintaining a complex system requires the expenditure of energy, and all energy transformations necessitate the creation of waste energy in the form of heat. This means that Life is both a fight against entropy as well as a vehicle for its increase. It may even be the case that, globally, entropy increases more than it is reduced in the living system. Life, anywhere and in any form, is a way for the universe to hasten its approach to maximum entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a paper from a few years ago that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.englandlab.com/uploads/7/8/0/3/7803054/2013jcpsrep.pdf&quot;&gt;applies the rigor of statistical mechanics to cellular self-replication&lt;/a&gt;. Although I have yet to work through and understand the calculations, the paper’s author, Jeremy England, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-thermodynamics-theory-of-the-origin-of-life-20140122/&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that some of his work shows “the more likely evolutionary outcomes are going to be the ones that absorbed and dissipated more energy from the environment’s external drives on the way to getting there.” In other words, there is an evolutionary pressure in favor of systems that can more readily make use of energy from their environment. The better able a system is to find and use resources, the more likely it is to survive and propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology exists because it has made human beings more efficient at finding and using resources. As we have developed our technology it has begun to take on a life of its own, some of it even beginning to achieve something akin to an autonomous metabolism, like a flashlight’s periodic consumption of batteries. We feed our tech because it is useful to us, and we maintain our technical systems through the extraction and processing of resources from the natural world. The technology of our transportation infrastructure is maintained through rebuilding bridges and repaving roads. Our information infrastructure is maintained through the mining of rare metals and the production of energy. Kelly believes that the growth of the technium - its complexity, its order, its need for energy and exotropic increase - is a natural extension of organic life, a virtually inevitable result of our push to organize the world and make our way through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of technology is that the benefits it presents, the paths it opens for people to explore creativity and self-awareness, come with costs: energy, resources, and the conversion of order into disorder that must occur in the environment around it. Kelly believes that the positives outweigh the negatives, that everything enabled by tech more than accounts for its downsides. There are too many variables to run an accurate cost-benefit analysis, and so it comes down to a matter of faith. In any case, if entropy increase is in fact a natural by-product of any complex system, then life itself necessarily involves a certain amount of chaos to be produced. In other words, destruction is inevitable, an unavoidable outcome of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a proponent of both science/tech as well as ecology I am often confronted with the dueling requirements of pushing forward the former at the expense of the latter. I appreciate the knowledge opened up by science, the abilities opened up by technology, and the vastness and beauty of the natural world. I want to find ways to live as sustainably as I can, to reduce/reuse/recycle, to make the world greener. Essentially: to do no harm. Unfortunately, the avoidance of harm cannot be a primary goal, since carried to its logical conclusion it negates all life. Instead, I must attempt to find a comfortable compromise, some line in the sand that delineates my behavior, and move on. For while the negative aspects of living are unavoidable, the positive aspects are not. Destruction is inevitable, creation is not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="complexity" /><category term="entropy" /><category term="life" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">A living organism survives by taking structured energy in the world around it and producing less structured waste energy.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is human-technology symbiosis pro-life?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/wtw-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is human-technology symbiosis pro-life?" /><published>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/wtw-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/wtw-2/">&lt;p&gt;One of the things discussed by Kevin Kelly in his book &lt;em&gt;What Technology Wants&lt;/em&gt; is the growing symbiosis between humans and their technology, in which he compares our use of pen and paper for long division to the use of search engines and the distributed knowledge base of the internet for memory and fact retrieval. There is a continuum between one and the other, not a discontinuity. This comparison is made to ward off techno nay-sayers who worry about our growing reliance on technology. We have already been reliant on our technology for millenia. What has been happening recently is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own approach to new technologies is to rapidly snap them up while at the same time worrying about how they might be affecting me and my relationship to the world. There are benefits to any new technology, just as there are downsides, and it might be as Kelly says that the ups outweigh the downs. This balance can be a hard one to assess, and there is the danger that any individual, localized assessment is too short-sighted, placing too much emphasis on the immediate short-term gains without giving enough care to the potential long-term losses. Certainly when I decide to own and use a smartphone I am recognizing the value it bring to my life in being more connected and in having a portable and flexible pocket computer - a camera, a notebook, etc. But invisible to me are the industrial systems in place to create that device and bring it to me: the mines for raw materials, the factories, the large scale infrastructures. The effects of these systems can enter into my calculations only in a limited, disembodied kind of way. How can we be sure that an accurate assessment is being made of the balance? Or is this the kind of thing that can only be determined after the negative aspects of our decisions have become widespread or large enough to be noticed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ecological effects of technology are the extended personalized effects as technology changes habits and effectively rewires the brain. Technology use can, at times, be very similar to drug use, in that the reward centers of our brains are triggered to release neurochemicals such as dopamine (consider your internal response when opening a social media app and seeing new ‘likes’ or enticing new posts). Technology can be addictive. Sometimes this addiction is a deliberately designed and optimized feature of the product, masked under terms such as “engagement” or “retention”). Can the long term positive benefits of a technology be a trustworthy part of the equation when usage seems to be driven, at least in part, by short term psychological needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly points out that humans seem to have some predilections about the world around them: biophilia and technophilia. The love of Living Things and the love of Made Things. We love life because we recognize that it is a fleeting thing and we appreciate whatever shared connections we have access to. And we love our technological creations because they often represent the best parts of our rational minds, our attempts to solve problems and bring forth creations that may outlive us. In the sum of gains and losses taking place in the world around us, we hope that the balance comes out in favor of Life, including its beauty, its growth, and its seeming tendency toward greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the constantly shifting balance between the Natural world and the Artificial one, we hope that any negative aspects of our technological creations, such as environmental pollution and degradation, income inequality and social instability, etc., are more than overcome by the ability of these inventions to lead sizable portions of the population forward into knowledge, autonomy, and transcendence. In this comparison, the time scales of Nature versus Artifice end up leaving much to a matter of faith. Natural systems have emerged on almost geologic time scales and have proven themselves to be stable, dependable, and overwhelmingly in favor of the existence of life and the emergence of consciousness and complex symbiotic systems. The timescale of technical systems now evolves much faster than even a single human generation and has not yet entirely proved that it is best for a single individual (although many will readily admit that they are better off with technology’s benefits), let alone a society or ecosystem. When it comes down to the facts, Nature has proven itself to be stable and pro-life, while Technology has not yet sufficiently demonstrated this. All the same, Technology exists because we continue to find in it a great potential to carry us forward into uncharted territory, land that once explored is readily admitted to be better than that from which we came. The hope for better things is a wonderful motivator, but we must be consably aware of the elements of the greater world, and of ourselves, that might be put in jeopardy by this pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="technology" /><category term="progress" /><category term="book" /><category term="nature" /><summary type="html">Nature has proven itself to be stable and pro-life.

As one of the founders of the magazine Wired he is obviously very pro-technology, but he also comes with the experience of roughly a decade of low income nomadic travel, experience that informs his perspective on the specific role that technology can or should play in our daily lives. Technology is good, he says, despite its many obvious ills, partly because of the choices it opens up for us. A plurality of choices is always better than no choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I watched a TED talk from psychologist Barry Schwartz on the ‘paradox of choice’. This phenomena is one of paralysis and regret: the &lt;strong&gt;paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; that can be induced by extreme diversity of choice, such as walking into a grocery store and seeing dozens of options for something as simple as a toothbrush, and the &lt;strong&gt;regret&lt;/strong&gt; that follows after a decision has been made, when one deconstructs the decision and reflects on other possible outcomes. Schwartz’s conclusion was that choice does not necessarily mean happiness, and our ability to navigate through the ocean of choices building before us will be one the great challenges of the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly acknowledges the ideas behind the “Paradox of Choice”, but he maintains that choice is still better than no choice, and the diversity of options opened up by technology will be answered by technology, the form of which will be “choice-assist technologies” that provide decision making support. Forms of this are all around on the web in the form of search engines (navigating the diversity of web pages) and recommendation systems (navigating the diversity of products and media). Despite the enormous collection of songs available on Spotify I do not fret over what to listen to (most of the time), but instead rely on intelligent playlists and radio stations to feed me media. Despite the millions of objects available on Amazon, choice-assist technologies in the form of recommendations and user reviews enable people to purchase in ways that are assumably regret limited. At some point these decision technologies may make their way into the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are additional problems opened up by choice. William Lowrance discusses a major one in his book &lt;em&gt;Modern Science and Human Values&lt;/em&gt;, which is that sometimes the choices we create have a fundamentally tragic nature. These decisions are not tragic in the sense of being something bad or unhappy, but in the high sense of the word: “the deliberate confrontation of deeply important but nearly irresolvable life issues”. The invention of new medical technologies, such as the artificial respirator, opens up new possibilities, chief among them the potential to extend someone’s life with the hope that they be able to start breathing on their own, but it also involves the conflict between various values both ideal and practical: the sanctity of life, the accumulation of medical costs, the rightness of potentially keeping someone indefinitely in a vegetative state. The conflict between values is what causes Lowrance to declare technological progress to be a “deliberately directed tragedy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology opens doors. Choices we never used to have are now abundant and ubiquitous. Many of these are low-grade, low-impact, and contribute to perhaps some overall anxiety that may be ameliorated by choice-assist technologies. Others present to us conflicts between our deeply held values, and the decisions we make may themselves start to define a hierarchy between our values that never needed to exist before. It may be that we don’t know who we are and what we believe until we are presented with situations that require us to choose from a number of different paths. Technology is building these paths, but we still must choose which to walk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="technology" /><category term="progress" /><category term="book" /><summary type="html">technology is &quot;deliberately directed tragedy&quot;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Book Review - Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Book Review - Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb" /><published>2017-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/black-swan-review/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; is a book about risk and uncertainty presented as a mixture of philosophy and statistics with elements of personal experience brought in to illustrate certain ideas. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb (who refers to himself as NNT), spent years as a trader on Wall Street and thus considers himself an empiricist wise in the ways of the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary thesis of &lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; centers around the existence of important, unpredictable events NNT calls Black Swans. The occurrence of unpredictable events should not come as a surprise to anyone, however it is not only the unpredictability of an event that makes it a Black Swan but also that it has considerable consequences for the system it affects and, crucially, it is often retrospectively explained in such a way that it seems entirely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of such things, inherently unpredictable events that play fundamental roles in the evolution of the systems they affect. A key example given by NNT is that the ten largest one-day moves in the stock market account for half of its current value. These kinds of jumps are not included in typical stochastic models, emerging instead from the complicated dynamics of the global economy, but they nevertheless play an unignorable role in the outcome of the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hits on a key theme that NNT stresses again and again. Statistical fluctuations and simple regressions of the kind most often treated by financial models capture the boring, predictable behavior of a system but totally ignore the existence of intrinsic and fundamental phenomena that may have major effects. The true danger of Black Swans is realized when they affect systems in which there are people trying to make predictions and assess risk using tools inappropriate to the task. This exists within the realms of financial trading and econometrics, where NNT asserts that models of the world formulated by many social scientists and economists handle randomness and uncertainty in entirely unrealistic ways. Too many people are in love with Platonic idealizations of the world and the interactions taking place within it. Events that occur outside these idealizations are seen as outliers or flukes, rather than as inherent elements of the larger system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book NNT wages a particularly focused crusade against Gaussian statistics, in which large deviations from the mean are extremely unlikely, and pushes instead for the use of Mandelbrotian (also referred to as fractal or power law) statistics. Power law statistics are scale invariant, meaning that events of different magnitudes maintain the same relative frequency and large scale events are much more common than in the Gaussian mindset. Gaussian statistics are most applicable, NNT argues, in very specific or localized realms, such as the distribution of heights of a population, but not in more complex systems such as financial markets. To use them in such scenarios is misleading and ignorant and introduces unnecessary (and unforeseen) levels of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is one to do in the face of inherent uncertainty and unpredictability? His advice: maximize exposure to the gains induced by positive Black Swans, minimize exposure to the losses imposed by negative Black Swans. Recognize the existence of unknown unknowns. Put more effort into preparedness rather than mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; is quite readable, and despite being predominantly concerned with statistics and risk assessment it deliberately avoids the use of equations or the dry language of textbooks. Instead it opts for the popular science approach, which employs the use of entertaining anecdotes and wraps complex ideas within simple metaphors like “Black Swan” or “Extremistan”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most popular science books there is bound to be some oversimplification, which in the case of &lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; appears in the dichotomy between Gaussian and power law approaches to risk assessment. This apparent dichotomy is reinforced throughout the book as opposing pairs: Mediocristan/Extremistan, Dr. John/Fat Tony, Gaussian/Mandelbrotian. Although useful for making a point, this explicit categorization and binning of the world is bound to obscure the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from a background in physics, I have been steeped in the Gaussian mindset. There is plenty within physics that can be attributed to Gaussian mathematics, such as the thermodynamically averaged motion of particles within a fluid governed by statistical mechanics, just as there are realms in which power law statistics emerge, such as the turbulence produced by a mixing fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of NNT’s consternation with social scientists is when they bring the tools of more Platonic fields like physics or mathematics into the realm of messy real world applications, but even within physics, which often deals with explicitly idealized and simplified systems, there are topics of study that range between the simple and the complex. It is always important to recognize where on this spectrum a problem lies and be able to address the full complexity of real world systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideas of &lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; are interesting and well-articulated, but one thing that I found distracting about the book was the constant deviation from the ideas to discuss the character of the people who held opposing viewpoints. NNT states that someone resorts to ad hominem attacks if they can’t find anything within a person’s idea worth attacking, but he himself can’t resist attacking both, characterizing the purveyors of Gaussian statistics as boring, unimaginative “empty suits”. It is obvious that he doesn’t consider the real problem within econometrics to be the tools being used but instead the people who, in his mind, foolishly and bewildering rely on such tools. The real purpose of &lt;em&gt;Black Swan&lt;/em&gt; is to call these people out, make them accountable, and to put them on the defensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the ideas of power law statistics are not new to me, NNT presents them in a way that shifts my interpretation of the world, and any book that can do that is definitely worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book" /><category term="review" /><category term="uncertainty" /><category term="probability" /><category term="complexity" /><category term="taleb" /><summary type="html">The Impact of the Highly Improbable</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">All known meteor impacts on Earth</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/meteor-impacts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All known meteor impacts on Earth" /><published>2017-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-03-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/meteor-impacts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/meteor-impacts/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/meteors/crater-grid.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had the opportunity to peer at the moon through a telescope you’ve probably noticed how featured it is. Its surface is pock-marked with numerable craters, and depending on its phase the sun can cast striking shadows. This was something Galileo noticed when he first pointed his telescope at the moon, and it was these observations that revealed the moon as imperfect. This upended the notion of perfect heavenly spheres and contributed to the acceptance of Copernicus’ theory that Earth itself was an imperfect celestial body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth, of course, &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a celestial body, just like the moon, and there is evidence of this all around us. Our planet has been and continues to be hit by debris from space, some of which leave lasting impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://dcarmody.carto.com/viz/ee204238-ade5-11e6-9558-0e05a8b3e3d7/embed_map&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map shows &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.impact-structures.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here on Earth. Impact structures are craters or the remnants of craters left by a meteor impact, and they show evidence of the constant bombardment our planet is under. The red dots show the location of an impact structure, while the orange circles show the estimated radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since some of these impacts occurred millions of years ago not all have visible craters. Instead, evidence of an impact is often built based on geological evidence like anomalous amounts of fused glass and shocked minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I made this map I poked around at a few structures. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteor, Arizona&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the only impact structure that I’ve visited. This land is privately owned and operated as a tourist attraction. The price for admission is a bit steep, but the crater itself is the best preserved on Earth, a remnant of an impact only 50,000 years ago.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/meteors/meteor_arizona.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manicougan&lt;/strong&gt; - Over 200 million years old, this structure is now visible as a ring lake in Quebec, Canada.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/meteors/ring_lake_canada.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicxulub&lt;/strong&gt; - The dinosaur killer. Although there’s not much to see anymore, this structure is what’s left of a massive impact about 65 million years ago.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/meteors/chicxulub.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are others, as well. Check out someone else’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wondermondo.com/Best/World/ImpressiveImpactCraters.htm&quot;&gt;list of favorites&lt;/a&gt;. (These are the ones that make up the collaged picture above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of factors go into determining just how big of a crater any given meteor might make. There are a few online simulators that allow you to repeatedly smash space rocks into out planet: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purdue.edu/impactearth/&quot;&gt;ImpactEarth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://simulator.down2earth.eu/planet.html&quot;&gt;Impact Calculator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Earth is an interesting place for many, many reasons. It is socially diverse and geologically complex, and there is admittedly much that requires our attention. Nevertheless, reminding ourselves that Earth itself is part of a larger context can bring an illuminating shift in perspective. These craters are everywhere. Visit and explore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-script-for-data-minded-folks&quot;&gt;Post-script for data-minded folks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few sources of the data used to make this map. There is a detailed dataset available for &lt;a href=&quot;http://impacts.rajmon.cz/IDdata.html&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;. I found the locations of this data to be slightly off from the visible locations in satellite imagery, so instead I used data scraped from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somerikko.net/impacts/database.php&quot;&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part of making the map was going from lat/lon positions and diameters to circles that accurately represented the structure size. The basic map markers within CARTO scale as you zoom in or out. It’s easy to create markers that are &lt;em&gt;proportional&lt;/em&gt; to the structure diameter, and these can be useful for seeing the relative size of the various structures. But I wanted to see the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; size, and I wanted this to stay fixed as you zoom. Of course, for all things technical &lt;a href=&quot;http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/81520/i-want-to-add-a-circle-which-stays-the-same-size&quot;&gt;StackExchange has the answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="space" /><category term="maps" /><category term="meteors" /><category term="carto" /><summary type="html">A map of impact structures on planet Earth</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Concertrip: Compose your perfect road trip.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/concertrip/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Concertrip: Compose your perfect road trip." /><published>2017-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/concertrip</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/concertrip/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/concertripLogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.concertrip.me/&quot;&gt;Concertrip.me&lt;/a&gt; was the site I built as a Data Science fellow with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://insightdatascience.com/&quot;&gt;Insight program&lt;/a&gt;. It takes user-entered information about an upcoming roadtrip, combines it with musician and concert data, and outputs a suggested roadtrip itinerary that attempts to see as many relevant live music events as possible. It was built up over the course of about four weeks using a number of technologies, including Flask, MySql, and Mapbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;site&quot;&gt;Site&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this site was a simple set of pages where users could enter some details about their trip (start location and date, end location and date, musical preference) and then see their suggested itinerary in an intuitively understandable way. There are several pieces that must click together in order for this to work: the framework, the data, the algorithm, and the display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flask-web-framework&quot;&gt;Flask web framework&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flask is a micro-framework written in Python. Simpler and more lightweight than Django, it provides the means by which actions and visualization on the front-end are tied to code and data on the backend. This is accomplished through &lt;strong&gt;views&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A view allows you to determine what happens when a user visits a particular url, potentially collecting information and chucking it into some Python code before rendering it in a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    def multiplyItByTen(number):
        return number*10

    @app.route('/')
    @app.route('/index')
    def input():
        foo = request.args.get('user_entered_variable')
        bar = multiplyIt(foo)
        return render_template(&quot;index.html&quot;, var1 = foo, var2 = bar )
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables passed within &lt;code&gt;render_template&lt;/code&gt; can be accessed using Jinja bracket notation. These brackets can be used anywhere in the template, including the HTML tags and JavaScript code (as I’ll demonstrate later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You've passed the variable { { var1 } }, but we multiplied it and now it's { { var2 } }!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-collection&quot;&gt;Data collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing can happen without data, and Concertrip makes use of several different sources to work its magic. On the front-end there are web forms that collect information from the user, and these are passed by Flask into the back-end Python processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk more about the actual algorithm below, but one of the elements that it requires is similarity relationships between musicians. This is a very interesting problem, but also very complicated, and addressing it in a substantial and effective way is its own project. So I outsourced it. It turns out that LastFM, a music appreciation site, has pages for every artist that contain a list of similar artists. Scrape all this and you have a database of similarity relationships. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the defacto standard for web-scraping in Python. It has simple syntax, is straightforward to use, and is quite effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urls at LastFM are constructed like &lt;code&gt;www.lastfm.com/ARTIST_NAME&lt;/code&gt;, so in order to automate the web-scraping I needed a large set of musician/band names to iterate through. This list I grabbed from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/artists/top-100&quot;&gt;Billboard.com&lt;/a&gt;. Once I had that, I ran through it to pull the first page of similar artists from every musician’s homepage. This gets stored as pairwise relationships in a MySQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being all about live concerts, Concertrip also needs to know what events are happening! For this I turned to Bandsintown.com, which has an API that allows event information to be pulled given a range of dates, a geographic location, and a search radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;algorithm&quot;&gt;Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is the most interesting part of the site, from my perspective, and the heart of its functionality. It is all based in network analysis and relies on the NetworkX Python library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artist-similarity-metric&quot;&gt;Artist similarity metric&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to know what events best match the musical preferences of the user I needed some way to assess the ‘goodness’ of a band or musician. I decided to do this by asking the user for the name of an artist they like and then evaluating the similarity between that artist and those that are playing live concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I was thinking of using the Spotify API to calculate distance in a high-dimensional feature space, but the API is built around songs, not artists, and I decided that putting together something effective would take more time than I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I outsourced the problem and scraped data from LastFM, generating a large list (~80,000 entries) of pairwise relationships. Using this I constructed a &lt;em&gt;similarity network&lt;/em&gt;, in which you can hop from artist to artist. The &lt;strong&gt;similarity metric&lt;/strong&gt; I use is just the shortest path between two musicians in this network. The full network graph is magnificent. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/InitialGraph.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s much clearer if I focus on just two musicians and the path between them. For instance, how are world-reknowned celloist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGgG-0lOJjk&quot;&gt;Yo-Yo Ma&lt;/a&gt; and thrash metal behemoth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unQZvhQ9Giw&quot;&gt;Megadeth&lt;/a&gt; connected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/tinyGraph.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting feature of the shortest path approach is that each step is a style transition, and the entity right in the middle is often a curious blend of the two on the ends. In this instance, for example, we find Jonny Greenwood, lead guitarist for Radiohead who sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSipfGtbf20&quot;&gt;plays electric guitar with orchestras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;route-finding&quot;&gt;Route finding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging “musical fit” is only one necessary ingredient - I also have to construct the roadtrip itself! There are a few steps to this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;form-a-search-grid-from-start-to-end&quot;&gt;Form a search grid from start to end.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/routeMapGridpng.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pull-events-in-each-grid-location&quot;&gt;Pull events in each grid location.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/routeMapGridEvents.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rank-them-using-the-similarity-metric-and-identify-the-top-one&quot;&gt;Rank them using the similarity metric and identify the top one.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/routeMapGridEventsTop.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;keep-only-the-top-one&quot;&gt;Keep only the top one.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/routeMapGridEventsTopOnly.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;construct-a-network-of-these-top-ranking-events&quot;&gt;Construct a network of these top ranking events.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph has a couple important features. It is directed, edges only linking one way, which for my purposes is used to encode information about chronological sequencing of events, as well as distance. Events are only connected if they are forward in time and not too far to get to in a day (500 miles ~ 8 hours * 60 mph).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weight-edges-based-on-distance-and-similarity-and-find-the-shortest-path&quot;&gt;Weight edges based on distance and similarity and find the shortest path.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/concertrip/map_output.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two optimizations going on here, minimizing distance and maximizing music (which is also framed as a minimization problem due to the choice of metric). The question that arises is, how do we take into account the relative importance of driving distance versus music preference? This is something I decided to leave up to the user, implementing a sliding bar on the homepage that allows them to choose which is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;displaying-results&quot;&gt;Displaying results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fancy as everything might be on the back-end, results are worthless if they aren’t understood. For something with such important geographic information as a roadtrip, the most intuitive way to understand the website’s output is with a map. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielcarmody.net/projects&quot;&gt;I love maps!&lt;/a&gt; I love maps so much that I had already spent time prior to this project playing around with JavaScript and Mapbox. This allowed me to adapt what I knew and implement some basic mapping relatively quickly (and within the project’s deadlines).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part was learning how to pass an array of locations through  Flask into the JavaScript template. The event information is created as a number of different arrays in Python and then passed to the map template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    return render_template(&quot;map.html&quot;, placesList = placesList, eventList = topEvents, startName = start, endName = end)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arrays are iterated over to place Leaflet markers on the map and populate the pop-up tooltips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;	for (i=0; i &amp;lt; .length; i++) {
		var locLat =  [i][0];
		var locLon =  [i][1];
		var tooltip = '&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;'.concat('Band: ',bandArr[i],'&amp;lt;\/h1&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Venue: ',
			venArr[i],'&amp;lt;\/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;',dateArr[i],'&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;');
		if (bandArr[i] == 'Start') {
			tooltip = 'Start'; }
		if (bandArr[i] == 'End') {
			tooltip = 'End'; }
		var color = &quot;#3ca0d3&quot;; // blue, color for unchosen event
		if (colorArr[i] == 1) { color = '#ff3333'; }
		L.marker( [locLat,locLon], {title: String(bandArr[i]),
				icon: L.mapbox.marker.icon({
    				    'marker-size': 'large',
    				    'marker-symbol': 'music',
    				    'marker-color': color })
			 } ).addTo(mapLeaflet).bindPopup( tooltip );
	}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a bit janky, but it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this project was an excellent opportunity to develop some core data transformation skills. The site still has issues, of course, the primary problem being that it is just far too slow. There are two reasons for this, both related to the underlying algorithm. The first reason has to do with the algorithm itself. Finding the shortest path is not a fast process, and doing this for all the events being pulled expounds this problem. Secondly, API calls are not fast either, and the number of calls being made also contributes to the lag in returning results to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, this site is more interesting and novel than it is useful. It’s greatest use was for me to learn all the various pieces that made it possible.

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I had the opportunity to join a few others in an excursion to the peak of Mt. Whitney, the highest mountain in the lower 48 states. It was and remains the tallest mountain I’ve ever climbed, and it also provided some of the most beautiful, exhilarating, and terrifying moments I’ve experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time I had recently started working at Astrocamp, a year-round summer camp in the San Bernardino mountains dedicated to astronomy and space science. It was a great fit for someone like me, full of outdoor oriented science nerds, people who loved in almost equal measure to discuss quasars or go for a nature hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were four of us that went. Three still worked at the camp - Paul, Kyle, and myself - plus Ben, who had recently left to venture around the Sierra for a while before taking up a wilderness fire-fighting job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben was the one who had suggested the trip. While peak-bagging around the Sierra on his own for a few weeks he decided he wanted to do Whitney, but for that mountain he wanted other people. Being in the Owen’s River area he had managed to get a permit without the lengthy application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Monday Ben called and issued an ultimatum about the trip. He had to pick up the permit, and so he had to know whether I was in, and who else might be. It was lunch at that time, and I was out on the deck with other instructors, including the two I had just been discussing Whitney with: Paul and Kyle. All of us said we were in. None of us knew what we were in for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in my nature an anxious person. I obsessively plan and research and visualize, sometimes visualizing the innumerable ways that something can go wrong and how I might end up dead or injured. I read weather reports: late week snow, perhaps as much as a foot on the ridge and around 6 inches at our chosen campsite at 12000 feet. I read about the dos and do-nots of glissading, and I skimmed several stories of people who had died in recent years from uncontrolled snowy slides off of rocky cliff ledges, some stories of which took place on the very mountain we were setting off to climb. We are unprepared for such an ascent, or descent, lacking both the proper gear and the knowledge and experience to use it. I called an outfitter in Lone Pine to ask about equipment rental. Ice axes were no, crampons were yes, but the crampons required stiff mountaineering boots, boots which none of us had. The footwear that I had, the closest appropriate choice, were a beat up pair of old leather boots that I picked up at a thrift store back in Madison. The leather was cracked and dried, the tread was all but completely worn away. They were totally inappropriate for the task, but they were comfortable as hell and only put me back $12. Snow boots they weren’t, but I knew that with a decent pair of socks I could walk all day in them with a pack on my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the week reading trip reports, double checking the gear I was bringing, and developing my mind towards the eventuality that we made it up to the switchbacks and had to turn around. I told myself that I was prepared for that, that if the conditions were sketchy I would turn back, if not saving face then at least returning with life and all limbs. I knew these conditions in my head, but the actual situation required to pull a hairpin turn and retreat was only a vague scenario, one which I hoped I could recognize if it came along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complicated wrench in this forward thinking plan was Ben, whom I had only known for five months but who I could already tell was pretty gung-ho, and I half suspected/half knew that he would push hard for the top, counting more strongly on his own confidence and more plentiful experience than on the lack of these things in the rest of the crew. I knew also, crucially, my own tendency to get drawn in by others, to push aside my own anxieties and continue forward because it was easier than telling someone that I wanted to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;departure&quot;&gt;Departure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Friday of departure came around, the last school bus of children left the camp, and Paul, Kyle, and I gathered in the staff dining hall to collect ourselves for the trip. We had a borrowed ice ax, no crampons, and Paul had been piecing together borrowed gear from a variety of people around camp, picking up a sleeping bag only ten minutes before we were about to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had our gear collected on the tables in the dining area and a few grocery bags full of junk food and fruit from the camp pantry. Grey skies outside had been casting drifting snow onto the camp all morning, but it had all settled down around noon. This lull turned out to be only temporary, and as we were about to leave the precipitation started falling again, dropping a snowy hail with the consistency of Dippin’ Dots ice cream. The three of us loaded up my car while a slick layer collected on the ground. I had a pair of tire chains in my car, so we decided to toss them on until we made it down the mountain and onto clear roads. I had never used the chains before, and for fifteen minutes we tried to wrap and link them around my tires. The chains seemed to be too small for the job. Now, tires to match my boots, we decided to set out, hoping that once we made it back down to the highway we could find it relatively precipitation free. Proceeding with trepidation down the steep street, I tested the brakes, only to find the wheels locking and the car sliding on the thin icy layer that stood between us and the gritty traction of the open road. I was uncomfortable with the trip already, and we had made it a total of a hundred feet from the start. I decided to pull the plug. We were turning around. I tried to shift the car into a driveway to pull a three point turn and bring us back, but we just drifted past the driveway entrance and further down the road. The only possibility left to us was to continue on and hope the road conditions improved before we found ourselves roof-side down in a ditch or tumbling bumper over bumper down a steep hillside. Continuing on for another five hundred feet brought us further down the mountain, down to an elevation where the snow faded away and the road cleared. We were free to move ahead. We followed the highway through the numerous twists and turns: down the mountain, through the cloud layer, and out into the sunshine of the inland empire. Redlands, San Bernadino, and eventually onto the straight line shot that is 395, carrying us to our destination of Lone Pine and Whitney Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Lone Pine as the sun was setting, but we needed to drive out to Whitney Portal, 15 miles and 5000 feet up in the mountains. Cell service was poor up there, and so we had only been receiving sporadic text message updates from Ben, who was somewhere up there trying to find us a campsite for the night. Driving that way took us past the Alabama Hills, huge fields of large red boulders, and eventually up the winding mountain road. Darkness had fallen by this time, and our surroundings were mostly obscured by the night, but it was apparent that large monolithic walls had surrounded us on our drive to the campgrounds. At the entrance to one of the campgrounds we found Ben parked with his headlights on. There were a few open campsites, so we grabbed one and settled in for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail from Whitney Portal to the summit climbs 6000 feet over the course of 11 miles. Completing the trip in a day, 22 miles round trip, requires good fitness, an early start, and perfect conditions. For those not so daring, there are two camps along the way to split the journey. Outpost Camp, at 10000 feet elevation and 3.5 miles from the trailhead, and Trail Camp, 6.5 miles in and at 12000 feet. Our plan was to make our way to Trail Camp on day one and push for the summit the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/WMT_Seg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;
(image source: http://www.willtrek.com/adventure/destinations/mt-whitney/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the trailhead we weighed our packs and took some time to distribute the weight more democratically. After that we were off, ascending the winding trail. We were well acclimated, having lived at 5000 feet for the last several months, and the miles ticked away. Just past Lone Pine Lake, at about 2.5 miles in, we passed into the Whitney Zone. We took our first break, admired the swath of pines and gazed up at the huge granite walls that surrounded us. The rock seemed enormous and impenetrable, but with any luck we would soon be achieving those heights and higher. Further down the trail we passed through the meadow that marks Outpost Camp. As the trail marched higher we started encountering snow, which in some places obscured the trail and made for slushy travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/meadow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/snow_trail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every group of people we met along the way told us that they had turned back before reaching the summit. For some the altitude had stopped them, for others the trudge up the mountain and through deep snow had taken too long and there had been no time to venture on. Although worrisome, our timing was better than theirs. Snow has been steadily melting since the storm, reducing some parts of the trail to puddles of slush and mud but clearing the way for further travel. We arrived at Trail Camp to find snow three to four inches deep in some parts but patchy overall, not at all the six inches that was said to have blanketed it only a day or two prior. There was even a clear patch, an obviously recently used campsite, where we were able to clear away a bit more snow and fit two tents side by side. At 12000 feet and with hardly any signs of vegetation, it was the most rugged camping I had ever done. And even at that altitude there were still large granite peaks that rose up on all sides, like Mt. Muir, a craggy prominence just south of Whitney, itself over 14000 feet. The setting sun fell right over top of Muir, balancing on top of the peak before disappearing behind. As darkness arrived the temperatures began to drop. Out of a single bowl the four of us shared a luxurious dinner of gnocchi and ramen and then dove into our sleeping bags. Since my water supply was running low I stuffed some snow into my water bottle and brought into my sleeping bag with me, but I had either used too much snow or my body never produced enough warmth, and throughout the night the bottle was merely a cold rock that I had to toss and turn around. The night also brought enormous gusts of wind that threatened to rip us and our tents off the ground and drive us into the rocks. I didn’t sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/tent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/beer_tents.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/ben_mountains.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning arrived with a 5:30 AM alarm, but the anticipation of the cold and dark kept us confined to our bags. I was well mummified in my bag, only exposing my nose and mouth to breath, but the frigid air that I felt on my face did little to support further action. Cross tent conversation confirmed the group decision to hit the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/east_facing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/paul_silhouette.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mountain was waiting, however, and time would not, so as the sky brightened with the coming dawn we arrived at the inevitable. The deliberate decision to remove oneself from the warm and comfortable embrace of a bed and step out into the cold, dark pre-dawn morning is one of the most difficult aspects of a trip like this one, as predictable as it is unavoidable. I stomped around in my boots as we heated water for breakfast, struggling to maintain feeling in my toes, and then to regain it. Slowly the sun began to creep up over the mountains to the east, bringing with it a feeling of vitality, if not yet of warmth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directly to our west was the climb up to the ridge. There existed two options for that section. Ascend the steep incline of the snow chute, which required the use of crampons and ice axes, or make our way up the series of switchbacks, which were also under a healthy layer of snow. Lacking the technical gear, our choice was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/whitney/kyle_close.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;figure&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the base of the switchbacks Ben gave the rest of us our first and only lesson in self-arrest. Our tools were poor. Paul carried the borrowed ice ax, Ben brought two beat up trekking poles, one of which he gave to Kyle, and I had with me a sturdy walking stick found somewhere along the trail on our way up. We learned to keep the tool on the uphill side as we walked, learned to step firmly and check our footing, practiced falling and catching ourselves on our gear to prevent a slide. It was two minutes of scant preparation, and if anything it drove into my mind the necessity of turning around if I ever felt I was out of my element. The very bottom of the switchbacks were too covered in snow to be practically possible, so we opted to skip them in favor of a short and steep snowy incline. There were already some tracks where people has ventured in the last day or two. Ben easily climbed up, Paul behind him, but as I made my way up the poor traction of my boots combined with my own poor stepping skills caused me to slide backwards with almost every other step. It was slow progress, but I eventually made it up by occasionally crawling on my hands and knees. Somewhere on the incline I swapped my stick for Kyle’s trekking pole to make the going a little easier, and after fifteen minutes or so we had joined up with the others. So far our day had been full of nothing but delays. We had left camp at about 6:30 AM, and it was now an hour later and we had barely even started up the switchbacks. There was still plenty of daylight left, but if we meant to attain the summit and hike back out to the cars then we needed to make better progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the conditions of the switchbacks were slightly better than the snow field we had just marched up, the going was still slow. Tracks were left from a group who had broken trail the day before, but the only group we talked to who had attempted to ascend via the switchbacks, rather than the snow chute, had turned back, so we expected the trail to give out at some point. The previous day’s weather had been worse than what we were now dealing with, with cloudy conditions, strong gusts, and sporadic snow. By contrast, we had perfect clear blue skies and a steadily rising sun. All the same, the knowledge that we might be pushing past where other groups had turned back filled me with trepidation. As we moved back and forth across the switchbacks we rose in elevation. For the most part it was simple walking. The snow in some areas was about calf deep and relatively dry. Traction was proving to be mostly a non-issue, though always in my mind. In some cases the trail was all but invisible, washed into the hillside by large drifts and discernible only as a slight depression in the surrounding snow. As we climbed, sections of the trail felt less like a walk up a hill and more like a cliff face traverse. Steep embankments of snow and rock fell away mere feet from where we walked, and although the snow felt solid I knew that if I slipped it could be a treacherous and painful tumble before I stopped. My own inclinations to turn around were steadily rising, but Ben’s determination and the absence of complaints from the other two left me in the position of simply trekking ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final switchback before making the ridge we encountered a steep and icy slope, the only thing laying between us and the relative safety of the ridge. Unlike the trail that had taken us to this point, the snow was crusty and required steps to be kicked into it. I was in the lead at this point, but the prospect of kicking steps, something I had never had to do, and the icy slope that fell away several hundred feet to one side, caused me some hesitation. I passed the lead off to Ben, who had by this time taken over wielding the tree branch as his self-arrest device. He proceeded slowly but confidently across the slope, making a series of shallow steps that allowed the rest of us to make our way across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the section where I met and crossed over my line. Each step I took felt like a gamble. Had I been on my own I would’ve turned around. Had someone voiced aloud their desire to turn back, I would’ve instantly agreed. Whatever the actual probability of my slipping and falling off the mountain at that point, I acknowledged it as a very real possibility. Mountains kill people. Part of staying safe in the outdoors is recognizing that nobody is an exception to this. Part of staying safe is knowing the limits of one’s own abilities, but part of adventure is pushing those limits. The difficult and dangerous aspect of limits is that it is impossible to know exactly where they lie until they are crossed. From that there is often no going back. The limit that I was now testing was the level of risk that I was willing to accept to stand on top of a mountain. On the rest of the trail up to this point, the balance of risk versus reward won out easily for continuing forward. On that final switchback, however, the balance shifted. Each time that I took a step I felt like I had surpassed my tolerance. I knew that the experience and abilities I possessed were not enough to keep me safe. If the same situation were replayed a thousand times, in how many of them would I have slipped? That’s a question I can’t know the answer to, because in reality, in the only situation that actually matters, I made it across the traverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the final switchback, we rested safely at the ridge that would take us the rest of the way to the summit. I was still a bit rattled by the trail we had just come up, but there was no time to dwell on it. There was a heavily snowed-in trail that needed to be crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the junction with the top of the snow chute we found a group we had met on the hike to Trail Camp. They had just made it up the chute, and two out of the three looked in poor shape, one fellow vomiting up his breakfast onto the snow. It was obvious that they would have to turn back. They asked us if we had any water we could spare, which we didn’t. I had a bit of water left in a bottle in my pack, but I had so far gotten by on eating handfuls of snow while walking. For all our under preparation when it came to gear, we were all quite well prepared in terms of fitness and acclimation. All of us had been living at 5000 feet for the last several months, and the previous two nights we had spent at 8000 feet and 12000 feet, respectively. Consequently, none of us were feeling the ill effects of altitude, other than an obviously quicker tendency to become short of breath. The final stretch of trail from the ridge to the summit would (thankfully, in my eyes) require more of our fitness than of our mountaineering skills, and for that we were more than prepared. Still, the path ahead was in no way easy going. Few people had ventured much further than we had since the snow storm the previous week. The snow was thigh deep in most places, deeper in drifts, and there was no well cut trail. Getting to our current location had taken four hours, making the time at the ridge about 10:30 AM. We had set a turnaround time of 1 PM, and if we weren’t at the summit by then we would have to admit defeat. The distance from the ridge junction is about two miles and takes about an hour in good conditions. We hoped to make it by noon, but we had little information about the trail ahead. Everyone we had talked to thus far had turned back before reaching the summit. Shortly after we started down the trail we met someone coming back our way. He had turned back as well. “Too tired,” he said. So we pressed on, following his footsteps for a while before finding his turnaround point and forging on ahead. Breaking trail at this elevation was slow going. The snow was soft and deep and we traded off the lead as we slowly progressed upwards. The cliff side fell steeply away in some places, but the trail was not nearly so intimidating as that which we had just come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trek took much longer than it should, or longer than I thought it should, in any case. Soon the peak was visibly, tantalizingly close. It seemed as if I could get there in 5 minutes. In reality it took us another 45 to wind our way around the steep part of the slope to where it eased a bit. We trudged through the snow and rock hopped, inching our way up in elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peak itself is relatively unpronounced, not a clearly defined prominence as much as a rounding of terrain, notable mostly for the fact that there is nowhere left to go, nowhere further up, not here, not in this state, not anywhere nearby for thousands of miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a flat, dry spot and allowed ourselves a few minutes to eat lunch and relax. The day was only half over, and a snowy descent, long hike, and six hour drive awaited us before we could finally relax again into our beds. There was a lot for me to parse. I wondered if all the risks were worth it. There is something worth pursuing about the ability to move confidently through the mountains, but that confidence comes at a cost. As the saying goes, “Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment.” The consequences of bad judgment is always a numbers game. Sometimes you come out alright, but sometimes… sometimes you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, though, we were sitting on top of the country, admiring the views.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“If the mind cannot bring to the world a set - or, shall we say, a tool-box - of powerful ideas, the world must appear to it a chaos, a mass of unrelated phenomena, of meaningless events. All traditional philsophy is an attempt to create an orderly system of ideas by which to live and to interpret the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;E.F. Schumacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are often called upon to not only provide analysis of data, but also to provide effective communication of those efforts. If data represents raw material and analysis is the process of mining to extract meaning, communication is the conversion of raw goods into usable information. That is a nontrivial step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-write-data-driven-stories-5-core-narratives/&quot;&gt;recent example from BuzzSumo&lt;/a&gt; of someone attempting to make sense of this need for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#61c294b4f0c8&quot;&gt;data-driven storytelling&lt;/a&gt;”. This article focuses on identifying the fundamental types of narratives one can construct with data, mostly about how to convey the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trends. For example, how smartphone ownership is increasing or decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rank order or league tables. For example, the politicians getting the most social media coverage or which areas have the highest crime rates.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Comparisons. For example, how one company is performing relative to another.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Surprising or counterintuitive data.  Data that challenges or confirms something that people believe to be true, or data that is simply surprising.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Relationships. For example, correlations, potentially through to causation and prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These narrative types are, for the most part, centered on the data itself and how to make apparent the quantitative relationships it reveals. Telling a story is much more than this, however. The reason that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positively-media/201101/the-psychological-power-storytelling&quot;&gt;storytelling is a powerful tool&lt;/a&gt; is because of its ability to engage someone and encourage them to action. Quantitative relationships may provide support of a hypothesis, or may even go so far as to provide explicit proof, but data alone are not enough to get someone off the couch or out from in front of their computer. In order for data to have an impact - to inform, to change minds, to incite action - it is necessary to implement the true elements of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been continually trying to find ways to improve my own storytelling abilities, and for that I have been drawing both from my experience as an educator in science outreach and in general advice for narrative fiction or non-fiction. I don’t claim to be an expert, but instead I am trying to formulate specific pieces of advice that I can give to myself to inform my own communication efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, what are the lessons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-good-lede&quot;&gt;Have a good lede.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;lede&lt;/em&gt; is the journalistic term for the short snippet of text that starts an article. It must connect with and entice the reader in as few words as possible, convincing him or her that reading ahead offers sufficient rewards. Traditional &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.about.com/od/writing/fl/How-to-Write-a-Great-Lede-for-Your-News-Story.htm&quot;&gt;journalistic ledes&lt;/a&gt; often give the essential details of the news article, answering questions of who/what/where/why/when/how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have many options for distributing their limited attention spans, from other websites to games on their mobile phones. Whether constructing a data narrative for print, the web, or for a business presentation, the fundamental way to capture an audience is to answer for them the question: &lt;em&gt;What do I have to gain by paying attention?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-audience-and-avoid-jargon&quot;&gt;Know your audience and avoid jargon.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point follows up on the previous one. Know who your audience is, what it is they find interesting, and what it is they find important. Keep in mind the fact that they will only follow along so far as they believe they will get something out of what you are telling them. Make this clear from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience for data presentations can range from those of a highly technical background and interest in specifics (engineers, scientists) to those with less technical knowledge but more interest in big picture elements (business, the general public). A data narrative should not be constructed for as broad an audience as possible, but for the audience it is meant for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different audiences will bring different levels of technical knowledge and interest. Think about what they already know. Define what must be defined. Use metaphor and analogy when concepts are necessary for comprehension. Avoid carrying acronyms too far away from their original definition. People will forget what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identify-your-main-characters&quot;&gt;Identify your main characters.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental mission of a scientist is to find, explore, and explain relationships. The fundamental mission of a writer is to create characters and have them interact. For a data science communicator, these missions are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If dependent and independent variables are your characters, data analysis provides the actions that move plot forward. One of the main goals of data storytelling projects is to reveal the mechanisms - the verbs - that link one character to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;construct-narrative-arcs&quot;&gt;Construct narrative arcs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data is the main character, and like all main characters it needs to confront conflict in order to show its strengths. This falls in line with some of Vonnegut’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2014/02/kurt-vonnegut-masters-thesis-rejected-by-u-chicago.html&quot;&gt;hand drawn narrative arcs&lt;/a&gt; (and what Vonnegut did by hand has more recently been done by, appropriately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/&quot;&gt;computers and data analysis&lt;/a&gt;). Data-driven problem-solving means that there is first a problem, and then the hero that sweeps in to save the day. Posing the problem adds tension and anticipation, all of which leads to the denouement of plot resolution that analysis provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-dont-tell&quot;&gt;Show, don’t tell.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face it, numbers are boring. Numbers matter when they are attached to things that physically exist (mild apologies to pure mathematicians). Any story that relies too heavily on the quantitative facts won’t be too convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make stories comes alive is to provide anecdotes. As science writer James Gleick once said, “ordinary people are more interested in friends and family than in science.” This is as true for data science as it is for the physical sciences. Anecdotes are not proof, of course, but they can make the data-proven results seem more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real power of storytelling comes from its ability to &lt;em&gt;engage the senses&lt;/em&gt; and make the audience feel as if they are not just listening but actively participating in the narrative as it unfolds. People &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; good stories, not just hear them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcocreate.com/3020046/infecting-an-audience-why-great-stories-spread&quot;&gt;Emotionally engaging stories are infectious.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kill-your-darlings&quot;&gt;Kill your darlings.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is commonly quoted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shesnovel.com/blog/kill-your-darlings&quot;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; in the writing arena. “Darlings” refers to those particularly self-indulgent elements of your narrative that, in reality, are probably only beautiful or interesting to you and add little substantive content. Get rid of them and you get rid of the extraneous material that might cause someone to reflect too much on the mechanics of presentation rather than the story itself. This covers things like flowery language, superfluous plots, overly technical jargon, useless metaphors, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joeysargent.com/2013/09/powerful-communications-cut-the-fluff/&quot;&gt;PowerPoint fluff&lt;/a&gt; (transitions and clip-art), etc. Ditch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deliver-all-material-in-bite-sized-chunks&quot;&gt;Deliver all material in bite-sized chunks.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first lessons that I learned as a graduate student when creating research presentations, and it was a lesson that only became more obvious when I began teaching middle schoolers. No one can sit for 50 minutes while you reel off an uninterrupted monologue. Establish a clear hierarchy in your mind (think book/chapter/paragraph/sentence), and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/chunking-information/&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; the whole presentation into portions that have defined boundaries. When presenting slides, give them piecemeal,  using short, isolated sentences instead of blocks of text (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://presentitude.com/10-ways-avoid-death-bullet-points/&quot;&gt;finding clever ways to avoid bullet points&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide-something-your-audience-can-use-immediately&quot;&gt;Provide something your audience can use immediately.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buzz term for this is &lt;strong&gt;actionable insights&lt;/strong&gt;. A person is most interested when they have some understanding of how your story is benefiting them now, or at least in the near future. Brent Dykes from Forbes Magazine identifies 6 ways to ensure that your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/04/26/actionable-insights-the-missing-link-between-data-and-business-value/#68c10b1265bb&quot;&gt;insights are actionable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment.&lt;/strong&gt; Analysis results should be tied directly to goals, whether business or societal or something else. Often this is a matter of evaluating important metrics and performance indicators and finding the levers that change them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context.&lt;/strong&gt; The impact of a result can change dramatically in different situations. Declining profits don’t look so bad if all your competitors have taken bigger hits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevance.&lt;/strong&gt; Insights must be delivered to the right people at the right time, otherwise no action is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specificity.&lt;/strong&gt; Specific advice is more actionable than general recommendations. There are fewer additional questions that must be answered and less planning that must be done.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novelty.&lt;/strong&gt; If you are telling someone the details of something they already mostly know, you are providing a report, not an insight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity.&lt;/strong&gt; You must be able to communicate your results clearly and effectively in order for someone to take the appropriate action. That’s what this whole thing is about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storytelling is an art, and like any art it takes time and effort to fully develop. As I continue to find myself discussing data and data-driven results, I hope to apply and revise the above advice. I also plan to zero in on a few specific data stories in a future post to examine how well they follow these principles. If you know of any such stories that have stuck with you, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’ve got. Take it, use it, let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="writing" /><category term="data" /><category term="stories" /><category term="communication" /><summary type="html">Identifying the basic elements of good storytelling.</summary></entry></feed>
