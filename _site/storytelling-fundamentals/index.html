All traditional philsophy is an attempt to create an orderly system of ideas by which to live and to interpret the world.”</p> <p>E.F. Schumacher</p> </blockquote> <p>Data scientists are often called upon to not only provide analysis of data, but also to provide effective communication of those efforts. If data represents raw material and analysis is the process of mining to extract meaning, communication is the conversion of raw goods into usable information. That is a nontrivial step.</p> <p>Here is a <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-write-data-driven-stories-5-core-narratives/">recent example from BuzzSumo</a> of someone attempting to make sense of this need for “<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#61c294b4f0c8">data-driven storytelling</a>”. This article focuses on identifying the fundamental types of narratives one can construct with data, mostly about how to convey the data itself.</p> <blockquote> <ol> <li>Trends. For example, how smartphone ownership is increasing or decreasing.</li> <li>Rank order or league tables. For example, the politicians getting the most social media coverage or which areas have the highest crime rates.</li> <li>Comparisons. For example, how one company is performing relative to another.</li> <li>Surprising or counterintuitive data. Data that challenges or confirms something that people believe to be true, or data that is simply surprising.</li> <li>Relationships. For example, correlations, potentially through to causation and prediction.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p>These narrative types are, for the most part, centered on the data itself and how to make apparent the quantitative relationships it reveals. Telling a story is much more than this, however. The reason that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/positively-media/201101/the-psychological-power-storytelling">storytelling is a powerful tool</a> is because of its ability to engage someone and encourage them to action. Quantitative relationships may provide support of a hypothesis, or may even go so far as to provide explicit proof, but data alone are not enough to get someone off the couch or out from in front of their computer. In order for data to have an impact - to inform, to change minds, to incite action - it is necessary to implement the true elements of storytelling.</p> <p>I have been continually trying to find ways to improve my own storytelling abilities, and for that I have been drawing both from my experience as an educator in science outreach and in general advice for narrative fiction or non-fiction. I don’t claim to be an expert, but instead I am trying to formulate specific pieces of advice that I can give to myself to inform my own communication efforts.</p> <p>That said, what are the lessons?</p> <h3 id="have-a-good-lede">Have a good lede.</h3> <p>A <em>lede</em> is the journalistic term for the short snippet of text that starts an article. It must connect with and entice the reader in as few words as possible, convincing him or her that reading ahead offers sufficient rewards. Traditional <a href="http://journalism.about.com/od/writing/fl/How-to-Write-a-Great-Lede-for-Your-News-Story.htm">journalistic ledes</a> often give the essential details of the news article, answering questions of who/what/where/why/when/how.</p> <p>People have many options for distributing their limited attention spans, from other websites to games on their mobile phones. Whether constructing a data narrative for print, the web, or for a business presentation, the fundamental way to capture an audience is to answer for them the question: <em>What do I have to gain by paying attention?</em></p> <h3 id="know-your-audience-and-avoid-jargon">Know your audience and avoid jargon.</h3> <p>This point follows up on the previous one. Know who your audience is, what it is they find interesting, and what it is they find important. Keep in mind the fact that they will only follow along so far as they believe they will get something out of what you are telling them. Make this clear from the beginning.</p> <p>The audience for data presentations can range from those of a highly technical background and interest in specifics (engineers, scientists) to those with less technical knowledge but more interest in big picture elements (business, the general public). A data narrative should not be constructed for as broad an audience as possible, but for the audience it is meant for.</p> <p>Different audiences will bring different levels of technical knowledge and interest. Think about what they already know. Define what must be defined. Use metaphor and analogy when concepts are necessary for comprehension. Avoid carrying acronyms too far away from their original definition. People will forget what they mean.</p> <h3 id="identify-your-main-characters">Identify your main characters.</h3> <p>The fundamental mission of a scientist is to find, explore, and explain relationships. The fundamental mission of a writer is to create characters and have them interact. For a data science communicator, these missions are one and the same.</p> <p>If dependent and independent variables are your characters, data analysis provides the actions that move plot forward. One of the main goals of data storytelling projects is to reveal the mechanisms - the verbs - that link one character to another.</p> <h3 id="construct-narrative-arcs">Construct narrative arcs</h3> <p>The data is the main character, and like all main characters it needs to confront conflict in order to show its strengths. This falls in line with some of Vonnegut’s <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/02/kurt-vonnegut-masters-thesis-rejected-by-u-chicago.html">hand drawn narrative arcs</a> (and what Vonnegut did by hand has more recently been done by, appropriately, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/">computers and data analysis</a>). Data-driven problem-solving means that there is first a problem, and then the hero that sweeps in to save the day. Posing the problem adds tension and anticipation, all of which leads to the denouement of plot resolution that analysis provides.</p> <h3 id="show-dont-tell">Show, don’t tell.</h3> <p>Face it, numbers are boring. Numbers matter when they are attached to things that physically exist (mild apologies to pure mathematicians). Any story that relies too heavily on the quantitative facts won’t be too convincing.</p> <p>One way to make stories comes alive is to provide anecdotes. As science writer James Gleick once said, “ordinary people are more interested in friends and family than in science.” This is as true for data science as it is for the physical sciences. Anecdotes are not proof, of course, but they can make the data-proven results seem more real.</p> <p>The real power of storytelling comes from its ability to <em>engage the senses</em> and make the audience feel as if they are not just listening but actively participating in the narrative as it unfolds. People <em>experience</em> good stories, not just hear them. <a href="https://www.fastcocreate.com/3020046/infecting-an-audience-why-great-stories-spread">Emotionally engaging stories are infectious.</a></p> <h3 id="kill-your-darlings">Kill your darlings.</h3> <p>This is commonly quoted <a href="https://www.shesnovel.com/blog/kill-your-darlings">advice</a> in the writing arena. “Darlings” refers to those particularly self-indulgent elements of your narrative that, in reality, are probably only beautiful or interesting to you and add little substantive content. Get rid of them and you get rid of the extraneous material that might cause someone to reflect too much on the mechanics of presentation rather than the story itself. This covers things like flowery language, superfluous plots, overly technical jargon, useless metaphors, <a href="http://www.joeysargent.com/2013/09/powerful-communications-cut-the-fluff/">PowerPoint fluff</a> (transitions and clip-art), etc. Ditch it.</p> <h3 id="deliver-all-material-in-bite-sized-chunks">Deliver all material in bite-sized chunks.</h3> <p>This is one of the first lessons that I learned as a graduate student when creating research presentations, and it was a lesson that only became more obvious when I began teaching middle schoolers. No one can sit for 50 minutes while you reel off an uninterrupted monologue. Establish a clear hierarchy in your mind (think book/chapter/paragraph/sentence), and then <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/elearning_design/chunking-information/">chunk</a> the whole presentation into portions that have defined boundaries. When presenting slides, give them piecemeal, using short, isolated sentences instead of blocks of text (and <a href="http://presentitude.com/10-ways-avoid-death-bullet-points/">finding clever ways to avoid bullet points</a>).</p> <h3 id="provide-something-your-audience-can-use-immediately">Provide something your audience can use immediately.</h3> <p>The buzz term for this is <strong>actionable insights</strong>. A person is most interested when they have some understanding of how your story is benefiting them now, or at least in the near future. Brent Dykes from Forbes Magazine identifies 6 ways to ensure that your <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/04/26/actionable-insights-the-missing-link-between-data-and-business-value/#68c10b1265bb">insights are actionable</a>.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Analysis results should be tied directly to goals, whether business or societal or something else. Often this is a matter of evaluating important metrics and performance indicators and finding the levers that change them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Context.</strong> The impact of a result can change dramatically in different situations. Declining profits don’t look so bad if all your competitors have taken bigger hits.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Relevance.</strong> Insights must be delivered to the right people at the right time, otherwise no action is possible.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Specificity.</strong> Specific advice is more actionable than general recommendations. There are fewer additional questions that must be answered and less planning that must be done.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Novelty.</strong> If you are telling someone the details of something they already mostly know, you are providing a report, not an insight.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Clarity.</strong> You must be able to communicate your results clearly and effectively in order for someone to take the appropriate action. That’s what this whole thing is about.</p> </li> </ol> <hr> <p>Storytelling is an art, and like any art it takes time and effort to fully develop. As I continue to find myself discussing data and data-driven results, I hope to apply and revise the above advice. I also plan to zero in on a few specific data stories in a future post to examine how well they follow these principles. If you know of any such stories that have stuck with you, please let me know.</p> <p>That’s what I’ve got. Take it, use it, let me know what you think.</p> <div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#writing" title="Pages tagged writing" class="tag"><span class="term">writing</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#data" title="Pages tagged data" class="tag"><span class="term">data</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#stories" title="Pages tagged stories" class="tag"><span class="term">stories</span></a><a href="http://localhost:4000/tags/#communication" title="Pages tagged communication" class="tag"><span class="term">communication</span></a></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/storytelling-fundamentals/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Like</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/storytelling-fundamentals/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/storytelling-fundamentals/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.dlmenu.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.goup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/jquery.fitvid.min.js"></script> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <!-- Asynchronous Google Analytics snippet --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-50791294-1', 'auto'); ga('require', 'linkid', 'linkid.js'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'dan'; (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); (function () { var s = document.createElement('script'); s.async = true; s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/count.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('HEAD')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('BODY')[0]).appendChild(s); }()); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a>
