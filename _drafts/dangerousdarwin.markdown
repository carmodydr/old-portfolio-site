- evolution is an algorithmic process that has resulted in the emergence of intelligence and the appearance of design.

- questions raised for me: what about the algorithmic process of natural selection results in the appearance of complex systems? does a more complex system have some inherent advantage (perhaps longevity or virality?) and does natural selection itself arise from some process?

- this is related in some ways to the stability of complex systems, stability being related to longevity. perhaps some 'descent with modification' result in more stable systems which are more likely to produce descendants. time scale is important (humans are interfering with that now). 

- a quote from Richard Gregory, "life is a systematic reversal of entropy". what about the algorithmic process of evolutionary is organizational rather than destructive, and how did this come to exist in a universe in which entropy constantly pushes towards maximum disorder?

perfect place to bring in museum experience (chicago?) with butterflies. and the version i made myself with flocks.

- a thought: life is fundamentally tied to energy conversions. perhaps it in some way improves the efficiency of entropy production, at the cost of localized entropy reduction? need to think more about life and energy conversion, energy gradients in both idealized and actual systems.

- growth in complexity is in some way tied to gradients in some resource. i was thinking about this the other week when considering the job of medical coders, people who translate diagnoses and procedures assigned by doctors into the medical codes interpreted by health insurance companies. this is a position that has arisen due to the time/cost of performing this coding. a new niche has emerged in the medical ecosystem, one that has room for an additional person. this is a growth in complexity.

- similarly, plants arose to feed off the energy of the sun, and herbivores arose to feed off the energy of the plants, etc. 

- game of life, self replicators. some self-replicating piece of nature that proteins became attached to

- early life (or self-replication) was a tournament of luck rather than a tournament of skill. this is before true natural selection. many opportunities, of different values, and you are eventually going to hit upon one that succeeds. this is how Order (evolution) can arise out of Chaos (multiverses, or multiple interacting proteins on earth). And evolution is Design out of Order.

- definition of life as distinct entity with autonomous metabolism. so a person. but what about the planet as a whole? how can we describe a metabolism, as a black box with inputs and outputs. And there is an energy extraction taking place, an energy conversion, and a generation of entropy. looking at the organization of the entity, the input material, and the output material.
