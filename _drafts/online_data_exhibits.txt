show, don't tell

engage intellect and emotions

Food Insecurity Graphics
(really good)
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/food-insecurity-index/
- plenty of interactivity, good simple entrance, simple and straightforward action
- tool tips anyway
- but lacks the easy ability to go much more in depth
- some pop-up buttons with more info
- about section is a long section of text


accessibility (what technologies are used)
connect information
structure vs. unstructure data
- charts
- maps
- images
- video
- audio
narrative flow, ability to wrap around


From: http://www.howdesign.com/featured-design-news/experience-design-public-spaces/
1. Design for different levels of engagement
"make the audience forget they're an audience"
2. Be spatially literate.
3. Give people superpowers.
"minor interaction results in a major moment"
4. User failure is not an option.
"When something doesn’t work in the way it’s supposed to, it’s the fault of the experience and its creators, not the person interacting with it"
5. Be conscise.
"even a breeze by can result in a good impression"
6. Don't get hung up on technology.



Multiple scales of interaction. For those passing by, for those more interested.
